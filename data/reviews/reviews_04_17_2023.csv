He also had a hand in the second OP of Bakemonogatari, which is pretty similar to this. The characters are expressive and well designed, and the animation has a good amount of impact even if it is sometimes hard to know what's going on.As for GLAY, their music isn't bad, but I can't really say I'm a fan.

0;Kiekaketa Monogatari-tachi no Tame ni;Paraturtle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Paraturtle;6;Story:For the most part, the description above covers what happens. However, the story itself is filled to the brim with symbolism. That, paired with 0 dialogue makes for a rather cerebral experience, something I've come to really enjoy with Naoyuki's work.The story itself is a process of confusion, community, and ultimately, convection. It's very ethereal, something that steps out beyond the standard westernized idea that one must do things on their own, take it on the forehead at all times, and then die with those burdens. Naoyuki tells a different narrative where someone embarks on a journey carrying their burdens but finds themselves in need of others help. However, it never states that a sense of singularity is negative. There's a sequence just after our protagonist communes with others that he must travel alone for a short spell before he meets that which will ultimately relieve him of that which weighs him down.Art:Although the stop-motion isn't all that great, the artwork put into the settings and characters is incredibly compelling. It's very evident that each backdrop, character, and prop is indicative of something far more than what it initially looks like. I found it a lot of fun to think about what they may represent, and then felt an incredible sense of accomplishment upon finally realizing what it may be.Sound:Very lo-fi. Songs are cut short. Some songs have mistakes as well. Unfortunate, but fitting. Still requires points off, however.Character:Everything represents something. Beyond that, there's nothing else. Don't expect to add anybody to your favorites.Enjoyment:Quaint. The claymation, music, and symbolism made for something I didn't expect and then felt glad I experienced it. It's very enjoyable, and perhaps my favorite work from Naoyuki Tsuji.Final Thoughts:The many burdens he carries are self-afflictions that cross from irrational issues to very pervasive ones. Although vague, I'd like to think his mask is representative of self-hate, something that can only be defeated by community. As someone who spends a lot of their time alone, I find this one incredibly easy to relate too. It's an irrational weight to carry, self-hate, but only through others can I find myself rid of such an ugly burden. There's plenty of other things to connect to in this work, and I found a lot of it to be very inspirational. I'm definitely going to recommend this to a lot of friends.((If you liked this review, friend me for new reviews on other works, both manga and anime!));Mixed Feelings
0;Nagagutsu Sanjuushi;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;5;"Following the success of the first Puss in Boots movie three years earlier, Toei Animation pinned their hopes an this sequel, ""The Return of Pero"". In fact, the studio was so infatuated by the character, that they made Pero their mascot, which has endured for almost five decades.This time, Pero finds himself in the Wild West of the 1880's, stuck in the middle of a fairly paint-by-numbers story that could have been the plot of any of the scores of Westerns that Hollywood churned out in the fifties and sixties.Young Anna is returning home by stagecoach from back east, only to find her father has been murdered and the town is in disarray after some undesirables have moved in. Intent on keeping their counterfeiting ring secret, the gang has murdered several sheriffs, and tries to drive away Anna as well, who is on the verge of uncovering their scheme. It is up to a mysterious outsider to save the day!Now, you would expect that 'mysterious outsider' to be Pero, right? Well, actually, in this movie he sort of ends up just being along for the ride. Pero, the titular character and the Pride of Toei, ends up being nothing more than an incidental character added in mostly for comic relief and foil, from beginning to end. If you were to take him out of the movie completely, it would not greatly affect the overall plot.Like Animal Treasure Island from Toei the year before, this movie contains a mix of humans and anthropomorphic characters. All the serious actors being human, all of the more comical characters (aimed to keep the younger kids involved) are animals, such as Pero and a band of ""Indian"" mice, and three bumbling cats chasing after Pero. The animation style is also largely the same as Animal Treasure Island (no surprise), with a heavy Disney influence, only this time lacking the magical Miyazaki touch that make Animal Treasure Island a more enjoyable feast for the eyes.The basic Western plot is a straight-up serious Western, even if it is aimed at a pre-teen audience. Which only makes the cartoony antics of Pero and the little Indians that much more jarring to watch when they are shoehorned in to the story. They should have gone either way: Either a non-humorous drama, or a full-out slapstick comedy. By mixing the two, it just detracts from the overall finished product.And in the end, we are left with a sequel that is a lesser compared to the original, where the character in the name of the movie itself is largely unnecessary.";Mixed Feelings
1;Nagagutsu Sanjuushi;LightScaryRobo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LightScaryRobo;5;This is a sequel to Nagagutsu wo Haita Neko, but it is not important for the story for you to see that first. Pero travels from the East to the Wild West where he has essentially turned into a cowboy.Pero does not really appear to look like the same lovable character. His colours are slightly off, the same with the King Cat's three gunmen as well. A lot of what was mostly clear in the original film was a bit more blurry than the previous film, with the exception that the background characters had more detail on them.I don't know why, but the quality of the sound was dropped significantly from the first film. They used a slight variation to the theme song in the first film, but the audio quality for it, as well as the voice acting, was very poor. I know this is a dated film, but this is in terms of comparing it to the prequel.Pero - A kindhearted cat who is hated by King Cat and wanted dead for his betrayal to his species by always freeing caught mice.;Mixed Feelings
0;With You: Mitsumeteitai;Darkmage530;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Darkmage530;5;"Update: Q: &quot;Does it contain any nudity or ecchiness?&quot;A: Despite being based on an H-Game this show is quite safe to watch, there is no nudity. There is one scene in the second episode which seems questionable but things are averted before getting out of hand. You should not have any qualms about the viewing content in &quot;With You&quot;.I watched &quot;With You&quot; by streaming it so the actual quality of the video wasn't all that great and may have hindered the Art and Sound aspects some. I tried to compensate in my scoring and reviewing.The StoryIt honestly wasn't too bad, just a little weird and perplexing. The biggest downside is that everything is crammed into 2 episodes. I felt like the story kept being rushed in attempt to finish as fast as possible. Also at the end there isn't a feeling of completion like anything really happened.Art/AnimationDue to the quality of the videos I was watching, it is hard to get an accurate gauge of the true quality in the art. From what I could see, it wasn't outstanding and some of the scenes had some fairly poor animation quality. For only being two episodes long it could have been fleshed out a bit more. The character designs were one of the highlights, I felt they were pleasing to the eye. Many of the backgrounds seemed a little dull, there wasn't much detail or effort put into them.The SoundThe sound was mediocre. It didn't stand out and just kind of blended in and was there. The ending theme was eh, okay, nothing special. Sound effects were the highlight of the sound experience. There was a decent array of sounds used and nothing seemed really out of place. The voice actors were decent, they seemed to fit the characters fairly well.The CharactersI felt like there was a lot of potential here but similarly with the Story, it is too short to really flesh out the characters. The three characters involved in the love triangle are obviously the most important characters but it was hard to actually feel or sympathize with any of them. There were a few other characters that had major roles but in some cases you don't learn much about them, sometimes not even their name. Very little to no background information or history is given on the characters which made it hard to have any emotion for the characters.EnjoymentI wasn't expecting much from this show as a whole, so it didn't disappoint but there was nothing memorable. The length is just way to short for what they were trying to do. Four episodes would have been much more efficient. There was a little bit of comedy sprinkled in and the romance was mediocre. The show ended in a slightly unexpected manner but it seemed to wrap up quite quickly and it all didn't make much sense either.ConclusionI wouldn't go so far as saying With You is a bad show but it's not really good either. I realize the budget was probably fairly small but it really would have needed at least another 2 episodes to give everything more time to build up. Also the actual quality of the execution for it all was lacking as well. Once the show finishes you feel like you didn't go anywhere and nothing really happened. There was a decent amount of potential here but a few more episodes and a little more effort put into polishing the show would have bumped the score up to about a 7.I wouldn't recommend this show unless you're looking for another show to just add to your list. The one benefit is if you do watch it, it's short so you can get it out of the way quickly.";Mixed Feelings
0;With You: Mitsumeteitai;Skadi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skadi;4;"A few things are required when telling a romance story, chiefly being that there actually be resolution to the ROMANCE! But sadly within the romance genre, With You ~Mitsumeteitai~ doesn’t stand alone in regards to its epic fail. I seriously doubt even fans of the source material will even enjoy this uninspired adaptation.The romance genre, and overwhelmingly the one involving harems seem to be dominated by H-Game and visual novel adaptations and this series is no exception. Like most, I haven’t played the game so I cannot make judgments based on how well it adapted the game's plot. Perhaps it’s unfair to compare, but I know that these adaptations can be made successfully into wonderful series’ such as Kanon, Clannad, and ef. Though nobody is certainly going to confuse this for a KyoAni project by any means.With You ~Mitsumeteitai~ storyline is typical harem fodder. The uninteresting male protagonist suddenly is reunited with his childhood friend after six years out of the country. Of course this causes friction with the resident childhood friend and tsundere who is in love with our dull pillar of masculinity and but can't tell him that. As a side note...you know it is possible to have other story ideas. I mean that story premise I just gave you could apply to 90% of the harem romances ever made. Throw in some mysticism and some track and field activity and you have the makings of a bland story that falls flat on its face before even leaving the starting blocks.The plot meanders around and never develops anything satisfactorily. It starts off as a sports drama but beyond the first half of the first episode none of those storylines are ever developed or pursued any further. There is some uninteresting mysticism that is eventually resolved but like every other plot element the viewer is unlikely to care about it anyway. Even the leads ""reason to run"" which is seemingly important to the story in the beginning is completely meaningless when the revelation is made at the end. Speaking of the end, well there isn’t one. Nothing is really resolved in terms of the romance and the confession of love is completely meaningless and typical of harem-romance anime considering the end. So in the end I found myself scratching my head and wondering just what the point of the whole thing was and who I had to see to get that hour of my life back.Characters are also listless, boring, and lack any originality. The male lead is so bland that even though I am writing this less than an hour after viewing I can’t even remember his name. I know guys are dense but honestly nobody is this thick headed. You don’t care about him let alone any of the rest of the cast. Naori, well even though I am a fan of tsundere characters, I can see why some people hate them when I watch her. There is nothing original about her as she acts, behaves, and hell even looks like 99% of the other tsundere in anime. It seems as though it’s only these characters that ever show any real feeling or emotions in these types of stories. Naori constantly pines over the lead just praying for her to show him even a smidgeon of affection in return, but at least you get some genuine feelings from her where as none of the others in the cast give you any reason at all to believe they even know what love is. Her main competition is ultra moe stereotype Manami. She’s pretty much the polar opposite of Naori in personality. But with her you don’t get the same feelings of affection that you do from her rival and basically the only way you can be convinced she has this deep love for him is because the story tells you so.Don't let the cute pic on the series page fool you, artistically this anime is horrible. Just watching it you might assume it was produced during the dark ages of the early 90s but I was shocked to see that it’s not even ten years old. Besides hair color the cast pretty much looks identical, the characters with a few exceptions are not very attractive and the backgrounds and settings are as uninspired as the story and characters. The sound isn’t any better; the music is a relic and would be more suitable for something made twenty years earlier.Really unless you just absolutely loved the game this was based on, I see no reason why anyone would want to watch this. There is nothing to recommend as it pretty much sucks equally in every category.";Not Recommended

Maybe it is the attack of the outside world that got to her? Maybe it is the views of what people think about her that got to her? Something did, and it caused her to run in this exquisite art piece which is surprisingly enjoyable.There obviously isn't a lot to go on, but it was truly something of a good simple story with some extra detail that made this worthwhile.

0;Destiny Child;O_T_T;https://myanimelist.net/profile/O_T_T;5;Has a bit of intrigue on paper but goes all of nowhere with it.Tie-in ONA aren't like other productions. Rather than telling their own story, they have to promote a completely different one, often in an entirely different medium. Now, for what it's worth, Destiny Child does this. I can't say how well or not it attracted me to the franchise, being as I had briefly played the game long before watching, but it did manage to introduce the story, characters and world to a reasonable degree.That being said, it doesn't excel anywhere at all. Despite the premise having potential, without being given the reigns to a full story there isn't any room to really use it. The same is true for the concept of the Children (the given plural is Childs, I should note), who again aren't used to any interesting extent. So without anything being pushed to be impressive, the whole ONA ends up quite mediocre.----As mentioned, the story has some decent material, but there isn't any progress with it. Nigh all of the plot is delivered either via exposition or fighting, with the latter having practically no stakes, as it is never clear how many Demons or Children are present nor are any rules regarding the combat established. As for how the story is conveyed, the bulk is dedicated to the character arc of and navigated by the Deuteragonist. I wouldn't say this is explicitly an issue, but if told through the actual Protagonist then a lot more of the lore and mechanics could be explored.The characters are just vacant. Only the two leads have any kind of personality, and even then their arcs are pretty vague. Everyone else is one-note at best, and several don't even get a single line yet are significant enough to be named. For as much as it is later set up that Children reflect various aspects of their sources, this concept is extremely lightly used, despite granting many opportunities for interesting dynamics.----While the designs are great, with almost all being quite memorable, the artstyle itself is almost repugnant. Noses and cheeks are super red and shiny, a style that I personally detest. Animation has no problems, the effects around hiding the Demons and their Channel Evil were pretty neat, but nothing else really stands out. The music is listenable but not at all memorable, and there is no OP to speak of, only an ED, which is again alright but not notable.Little is seen of the Demon world, but the limited amount shown is quite interesting. The landscape near the end is particularly striking, and a neat departure from common interpretations. As for the tone, I couldn't really pin anything down, which goes for the themes as well. And finally, as for the miscellany, I thought that the unique contract styles of different demons were interesting, as was the second shown Child transformation sequence.----All in all, Destiny Child is just a short, inconsequential ONA with nothing particularly special going on. It could likely be improved just by delving more into the plot, but that would probably make it into a direct adaptation rather than a tie-in. Aside from that, the overall concept could be retooled into a different franchise, but again that wouldn't be an improvement more a replacement.I wouldn't go so far as to say it's an absolute waste of time, but it's certainly skippable.;Mixed Feelings

If you enjoyed series like Bakutsuri Barhunter, Kaitou Joker or Youkai Watch, this might be something for you.You should avoid this, if you dislike flat personalities, silly humor and total overacting.This series gets 6 out of 10 dancing ramen bowls for being overall enjoyable but loosing potential on the duels.";Mixed Feelings
0;Eien no Filena;kaanton;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kaanton;2;This isn’t much more than an awfully written and presented bland fantasy. The dialogue is poorly written, stiff and boring, with no purpose other than to deliver exposition. Which makes some sense, considering its length, they try to shove in as much as they can, but it doesn’t make for compelling storytelling.The characters are bland and generic, and the attempts at making them more nuanced or inserting grey morality feel juvenile because of this and the poor writing.There’s no understanding of how to build tension either, neither in the writing nor in the direction. The exposition does most of the job. The first episode mostly revolves around a battle scene, which we’re put into before we get any idea of who Filena is (aside from her backstory). The show then proceeds to ruin any sense of urgency we might have with extensive flashbacks, making the use of the cold open completely unnecessary.There’s also the show’s idea of what building tension is. When Filena is about to be attacked, there’s a quick zoom in (like a few milliseconds long) on her face, which is then repeated twice. This isn’t a very good representation of how one would feel in that situation, which is probably why it doesn’t fails at making the audience scared.The only good aspects of the direction come from the heavy use of visual metaphors and the bits of good storyboarding and colour usage that happen every now and then. Otherwise, it’s pretty unremarkable. There’s heavy use of flashbacks as well, ones that don’t serve much purpose but to pad out the runtime. A lot of the times the soundtrack doesn’t suit the scene and actively harms the tone the show’s going for. The fight scenes, rather than being exciting, feel like a chore because they’re very stilted. The show’s poor art and animation doesn’t help much in that regard either.The ending is completely unsatisfactory. It wasn’t worth sticking with it even for that. I don’t know why I bothered finishing this tedious piece of trash. Maybe it was out of some warped sense of responsibility towards the fansubbers (seriously, thanks to Orphan Stardust for doing it, but some things are obscure for a reason.). I could say a lot more negative things about it, these were just the broad strokes to warn anyone thinking of watching it.;Not Recommended
0;G-senjou no Higeki;Suavacious;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Suavacious;4;The aptly named G-senjou no Higeki is a nine-minute animation by Kuri Yoji, who you might know for the proliferation of his works across MAL's bottom 100. In fact, if you've found this page, the chances are high that you already have an idea of what you're getting into, but courtesy demands I offer an opinion, regardless.The visuals are standard fare for an indie short with the dementia tag: abstract, chaotic, occasionally vulgar, treading between metaphorical and meaningless, etc. There's room to swing either way on a judgement here, depending on your tastes. The visuals aren't why this short is bad, though.The defining aspect of G-senjou is the horrible and probably unethical slaughtering of the violin that ushers in the musical element. I don't have a hyperbole strong enough to stress how bad it is. It's literally just a complete amateur, probably Kuri, slashing away at a string once they figured out the angle that produces the loudest, harshest, most unpleasant noise possible. This lasts for about three minutes, before the musical focus shifts to using other instruments to produce more disgusting, wholly unenjoyable noises. To this short's credit, they're in synergy with the visuals, but something like that becomes hard to appreciate when annoyance or discomfort is the only thing you can feel while watching.G-senjou suffers from the same issues a lot of experimental, avant-garde media suffers from, in that it fails to find the balance between being artistically-rich, and being enjoyable enough for someone to even foster an interest in unearthing any meaning. And even if you do decide to dig, there probably won't be much to find anyway. All-in-all, an inefficient use of nine minutes, even for a seasoned fan of anime.;Not Recommended
0;Tomoe ga Yuku!;InfinityDude88;https://myanimelist.net/profile/InfinityDude88;6;"Tomoe ga Yuku!, or There goes Tomoe as it is known in English, is a 1991 OVA created by Tamura Yumi of 7 Seeds fame and directed by Takaaki Ishiyama. Released at the height of the OVA boom in the late 80s/early 90s, this film sought to ride off the works of similar previous successes in the industry. As a relative beginner to the world of anime OVAs, Tomoe ga Yuku! was an interesting film for me to watch following the far more violent and adult oriented by which I had previously associated with the era. In contrast, and as the Shoujo tag would suggest, this OVA mixes the gritty art and action-focused style of the time with a more youthful and optimistic overview of life. While this blend does not offer anything entirely special or unique and certainly has its shortcomings, the overall package does still come together to be a fun, yet short ride; one which I feel is slightly underappreciated when compared to the 5.35 average score seen on this site.STORY – (7)The story of Tomoe is a particular highlight of the OVA, telling a fun and compelling tale of a girl fighting against an evil organisation to protect a man in need, coming to form a deeper bond with him over the course of the story. Though this tale is as old as time itself, it is presented in a unique and enjoyable way, albeit one which leaves much to be desired. As stated by the synopsis, the story begins with Tomoe coming to discover that the stunt organisation which she is a part of is secretly a front for a group of assassins of which her lover is the leader. She therefore sets out to protect their next target, a man named Iori, whose stepmother has hired the group to kill him before his father dies, allowing her to take over their rich family business. What then ensues is a series of action sequences in which Tomoe attempts to rescue Iori, help him take control of his business and take down Green Ship in the process. The episodes are divided nicely, with one of her goals being completed by the end of each episode, leaving viewers feeling happy and hopeful upon the end of each viewing experience (although they are still easily watchable one after the other). The main area in which the story does falter is in its lack of greater explanations as to purpose behind the events going on. While everything that is presented does make complete sense, it would have been nice to see how the Green Ship was created and to learn more about the Tojo establishment. I understand that the makers needed to make cuts to fit within the runtime of an OVA and I am confident that these elements were more greatly explored in the manga, but it would have still been nice to see something more here.ART – (5)While not bad by any means, the art and animation of this OVA unfortunately do still fall short in many ways. This is in part due to it following the typical style of the era, one which has not necessarily aged well in the modern day. The characters all come off as stiff and a strange blend of realism and cartoon. Kazusa has sharp, drawn in cheek lines, whereas Tomoe has massive round anime eyes and, in combination with both characters’ huge, disproportionate amount of hair, result in this strange, traditional character design which comes across as a little too uncanny and off from a modern perspective. On the other hand, one positive aspect of this older art style is the grimy, dark colour pallet used to add an atmospheric and mysterious tone to an otherwise fairly upbeat work. This works particularly well when combined with the music and sound, creating a really distinctive style. In terms of the animation itself, Tomoe ga Yuku! is even more of a mixed bag. Moments such as the skating sequence early on in the first episode as Tomoe escapes from the Green Ship come to life beautifully, with tons of work clearly being put in to create a seamless flow of movement through the city. Another highlight is the panoramic shot circling around Tomoe at the end of the OVA, which despite being brief still appears impressive in its ability to totally and fluidly encircle around her in a time before 3D animation was even a thing. However, to counterbalance these moments of glorious animation, trade-offs were clearly made at other points. There are numerous times throughout the video where the animation amounts to little more than still images playing like a slideshow and overall the majority of the story sticks to basic, easy to animate dialogue scenes.SOUND – (6)Like the animation, the sound of Tomoe ga Yuku! has a mixture of pros and cons which result in a relatively mediocre experience. Throughout the course of the two episodes, approximately six insert songs are used by the artists Mink and Shinichi Ishihara. These songs are mostly pleasant enough to listen to, though don’t particularly stand out in any special way. In keeping with the melancholic tone of the work, each song incorporates a mix of synthesized keyboard, electric guitar and drums along with the vocals to create a slow-paced, slightly sad yet sweet song, mainly regarding the theme of romance. On the other hand, the background music of the OVA sticks to a much more intense, rhythmic style, only coming in during moments of action and fighting. While this is fine on its own, there were a few pieces which got a little annoying to listen to – in particular, one piece of incredibly repetitive music came to get on my nerves during Tomoe’s attempt to rescue Kuro in the second episode. The voice acting throughout the OVA was fine enough too, with nothing too much to complain about audio or acting wise.CHARACTER – (4)The characters of Tomoe ga Yuku! are by and large a major disappointment. Similar to my complaints regarding the story, the biggest issue with the characters is that almost none of them are fleshed out to any real degree. Instead, we only come to a rudimentary understanding of who each character is within the runtime of the film. For example, while we do see a very brief flashback of Tomoe’s life at the beginning of the story, we do not learn much about her other than that her friend died in the past and that was supposedly her reason for wanting to join Green Ship. Kazusa is also given very little motivation behind his actions, with the only details regarding his personal life that we learn are of his like towards Tomoe. While we do learn a little more about Iori, as his family life is the core of the story, he too receives little more than a few brief flashbacks to his childhood. The side characters are unsurprisingly also completely neglected from being given any real purpose, with Yoshinaka (Tomoe’s friend), Shizuka (Tomoe’s sister) and Kurou (Kyoko’s friend) only appearing a handful of times each and having almost no relevance to the plot at all. Shizuka’s inclusion feels especially confusing, with her only appearing briefly at the start of episode two and only having a very short conversation with Tomoe. The only reason that I can think of as to her appearance in the OVA was that she, and presumably all the other aforementioned characters, potentially played some greater role within the manga which was cut from the anime. Otherwise their inclusions completely baffle me, as this additional time would have been much better spent devoted to developing the main characters more.ENJOYMENT – (7)Despite its many glaring shortcomings, I still found myself having a good time with Tomoe ga Yuku!. The fast pace and interesting story kept me actively engaged throughout and the lacking visuals didn’t do too much to hinder my enjoyment of it, especially when considering the context in which this was made. Though the frustration of not being able to fully come to understand the characters and their actions did leave me slightly bitter by the end, the positive and optimistic conclusion kept me from staying annoyed from too long. Maybe my enjoyment of the OVA would have been lesser if my experience in this part of anime history was a little larger, however as a first peak into 90s Shoujo anime I cannot deny that I had a good time.OVERALL – (6)As a whole, Tomoe ga Yuku! Is a decent anime well worth a watch given its short runtime and fun story. While not a masterpiece in any regard, it offers an easy and accessible glance into a bygone era of anime suitable for anyone to jump into and try. The weak characters may annoy some who are looking for a more complete package and the outdated visuals can take some getting used to for those who are already well acquainted with modern anime, but the strong plotline, decent music and fast pace make it an enjoyable experience for anyone willing to give it a go.";Mixed Feelings
0;Pikaia!;Timz0r;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Timz0r;7;Pikaia! is an interessing educational anime, aimed for kids mostly, but it's quite entertaining to say the least for adults aswell that are interessed in prehistoric life. Pretty much each episode is very short to say the least. It begins with a recap what happend last episode and it ends with some over Japanese dubbed footage from prof. Andrew Parker from the London Natural History Museum explaining a bit more about some trivia what you have seen in the episode.Story: 6/10 (Fine)The story begins in the future when Earth itself is no longer inhabitable and the human race now lives in space, but a couple scientists that coined 'The Cambria Project' are trying to investigate the mid Cambrian biota to eventually find some clues how to restore Earth, so they send off two kids named Vince and Hanna temporarily back approximately 508 million years at the location what's now the famous Burgess Shale in Canada so they have to search for the animals to extract data that gets coined as 'The Lost Code'.Art-style: 6/10 (Fine)I'm not really fond of the art-style. Let's paraprase that. I don't really like all the Cambrian species are CGI models while the rest of the anime eyes much more appealing to say the least. But that's just me that I really don't like the combination of CGI and (computer) drawn anime. But it's amusing to see some Cambrian animals like the trilobite Olenoides sp. crawl around the seafloor and see the fearsome Anomalocaris sp. swim around in the Cambrian seas like how they are reconstructed in modern times.Sound: 6/10 (Fine)The voice acting and the other sound is done OK for a show like this. I didn't really had any isseus with the voice acting or the sound. It was just a bit wierd for me to see a caucasian man getting Japanese dubbed at the end of each episode and seeing yet another English Pokémon-like talking animal in a series. But besides that, I really don't have any mayor isseus soundwise.Charathers: 6/10 (Fine)The charathers are OK I guess. There's not much to tell about the charathers since this anime is quite short, so we don't really have much charather development. The charather Pikaia (voiced by Kaori Mizuhashi - Hidamari Sketch) however gives me way too much English dub Pokémon vibes, because it only can say it's name and it's apparently a hologram aswell. The charather however does remind me between the cross off a (friendly) anomalocarid and Manaphy from Pokémon.Enjoyment: 8/10 (Very Good)Even though this anime is aimed for kids, I did enjoyed it. Mainly that's because prehistoric animals are involved in this anime. Can I mention I wasn't familiar myself with the Cambrian worm like Ottoia sp.? So yes, I did enjoyed this anime.Overall: 7/10 (Good)In overall, since I'm sort of a paleontologist myself as my job/hobby, I do recommend this anime if you don't really know anything about the strange Cambrian period to learn a bit more about several animals from this strange and yet most of uncertain time period in a entertaining way and can handle the childish approach of the show. I'm looking forward to watch the second season of this cute educational anime!;Recommended
1;Pikaia!;Flueckli;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Flueckli;8;"Targeted at kids this educational anime does a fairly good job. There is always a thin line in educational anime between being interesting and becoming boring, but in Pikaia they were able to balance out the entertainment and educational parts.The story is pretty interesting, it often felt like being a fusion of futuristic elements, but also the past of Cambrian era. Mostly the pacing of the show was rater slow, except for their little but important adventure missions.There was usually at first a block with the actual pikaia episode (short recap & current episode) and after that the educational explanation block, in which they referred to the episode, the history/background behind it, but also to today's technology and research. In pikaia they were able to pique the interest from the episode for the follow-up educational part. After this, there always followed another short sequence (with simpler animation) in which the animated singers elfin' had a little platform to talk about the episode or the educational part.As I don't like such little short ""talkshow-ish"" sequences that much at the end of animations, I think it might have been great for the music cast to present themselves as well, so I don't mind that much anymore.Overall the music was really good, the opening suits the anime well, but also the background music was always well chosen. Good job on that!The animation quality was also on a good level and quite enjoyable.What I probably liked the most was the character design and the series composition of this series. It has been thought through and written loveable.The short anime episodes (about 15 minutes long) were a good choice as it stays easy digestible and relaxing to watch. I can imagine to watch this series after a stressed day after work/school. Don't expect deep hidden secrets, which have to be discovered by yourself, it is a series aimed at kids after all. Well done NHK!";Recommended

Requires some moment of thought to fully grasp the message laid out. There are a couple takes to what was the basis for this story here is what i think was the main source. It focuses on the idea of love only to meet an end. Love becomes hate. Until another love comes to play to show a side that was hidden. Seeing the hidden side connected that fate has side choices no matter what as long as you are open to it. In other words just because one path closes doesn't mean you are not on the quest you seek.Artblock censorship. love the idea it is creative to say the least but requires a lot of remodeling if people (audience) want more *wink wink*. Matches with plot. Art was portrayed well do keep objects of importance in focus.Sound: no complaintsCharacter: it is a man's p.o.v. on his life so having just a good background on him and an okay one on all his close associates is okay. Simply put good backgrounds all around given the plot.Enjoyment: Some shows are action focused this is a mix or action and mental. The artists/writers blend elements to the show that some take for granted. For example that camera is not a toy put a window or door. Show would have done better with out that creative censorship and more light heart approaches to stress their points.;Mixed Feelings
0;Samurai Giants;mathemagican;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mathemagican;7;Samurai Giants: The show featuring Nagahama Tadao fresh off Kyojin no Hoshi leading a staff roll that could make any one's mouth water with expectation including Ishiguro Noboru, Osamu Dezaki, Yoshiyuki Tomino, and a young Hayao Miyazaki on deck, theres no end to what a viewer could expect, and never once did Samurai Giants ever disappoint.Its worth mentioning here before i delve into the content how I even ended up watching some random baseball anime from the early 70's with less than 200 completed members in the first place. The truth is, I had been recommended Touch by some friends, and I decided that it would be worth understanding the tropes of baseball anime which Adachi's work would play off of, and Samurai Giants is the first major production following the towering Kyojin no Hoshi.Looking at Samurai Giants from the surface, it seems exactly what you might expect from a show attempting to live in the shadow of a trend setter baseball show about a star pitcher, following its own pitcher: Banba Ban. Banba is introduced as a reckless and emotional highschooler known to throw punches first and pitch so wildly his batting opponents cant help but shiver in their boots. Banba is a man who hates bullies, and this sets the stage for his incredible character arc to maturation as a person, a player, and a pitcher.A show about a pitcher is always going to focus on the pitch itself, and Samurai Giant's take on the pitching mind game is to pit the most creative monsters against each other. Each of Banba's takes on ways to throw a ball to psych out the sharpest batters out there is unique and entertaining and each plays well to Banba's wild nature, while all of his rivals never shy away from his insanity. From a trope perspective, Samurai Giant's path to live in Kyojin no Hoshi's shadow is through Banba's wild pitching, and the growth of Banba as a player along the way.Visually, man, this show looks great. Even ignoring the remaster quality increase, this show uses constantly engaging frame composition and a color palette that never fails to say something about the scene. The staff never seems to shy away from using what ever color suits the moment and that works as a strength all the way. The OP and ED's are largely made of clips from the show but the music performance is endlessly catchy.At the end of the day, Ive found yet another untranslated show the wider western anime audience is missing out on and I hope to see this show get the fan release it honestly deserves.;Recommended

0;Tabidachi: Ami Shuushou;PorthosMoonPower;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PorthosMoonPower;4;Project A-Ko was intended to be a sequel to Cream Lemon, one of the first hentai anime made. However, it was retooled into a parodic anime at the last minute and released as a double feature with Tabidachi: Ami Shuushou, the forgotten non-pornographic adaptation of Cream Lemon.Tabidachi: Ami Shuushou truly is not that bad, but not that good either. The 80s animation, as usual, is a visual treat, and the cool J-pop soundtrack is nice, if a bit generic, but the positives end there. The plot is unimpressive and borderline offensive, which one would expect from an adaptation of a porno. This movie includes incest, an obvious sign of its pornographic origins, and other garden-variety pervertedness, which makes it an uncomfortable watch. Seriously, the plot portrays the continuing of the incestuous relationship as positive and happy. If that doesn't build up the yikes factor, I don't know what does.I watched this because I was interested in its relation to Project A-Ko, and as someone who enjoyed Project A-Ko, I can say that Tabidachi: Ami Shuushou adds nothing to the experience and was largely forgotten for a good reason.;Not Recommended
0;Happy Kappy;karuhigamiDURV;https://myanimelist.net/profile/karuhigamiDURV;5;The anime is about the everyday lives of this little girl named Suguri Kinoshita. Her life is not so normal though because she lives with a magical pet named Kappy that has magical powers. The anime mostly revolve around normal everyday stuff like baking, cleaning or playing in the park and it has normal everyday problems like a balloon stuck in a tree, doing your chores or having fights with your friends. These problems are resolved though by having Kappy use his magic powers. The anime usually ends with a happy note after Kappi saves the day but other times, some trouble brews because of his interference. There is nothing groundbreaking in the anime though. The story is simple, there is no strong conflict and the flow of the events is predictable. It’s just a very bright colored five minute anime about fluff episodes.As the anime progresses, it introduces new characters with magical powers. The episodes usually involve the new characters, magical as well and related to Kappi, stirring up trouble and having Kappi use his powers to save the day. Once again, there is nothing really huge. It’s light hearted and cute. I can’t really expect much from a kiddie show that runs for five minutes.The characters in the anime are all fluff as well. They’re friendly and nice and caring like what you’d expect from a kiddie anime. Some characters are a bit unruly but the cuteness still dominates. The two main characters are pretty bland. Suguri is the typical girl that happens to have a magical pet. There is just enough of her personality to fill in the gaps of the five minutes. The same goes for Kappy. He’s laidback, cute, funny, and loves to eat donuts. That’s basically it and they remain the same from start to finish.I do admire how much the anime has achieved in the span of five minutes. Including the OP and ED, there is actually a decent amount of story in the episodes. There’s a conflict and a decent resolution to them. Don’t expect much though because the anime caters for kids. Everyone in the anime is friendly and the anime is predominantly made of cakes and butterflies.;Mixed Feelings

Some key indicators of low budge production are recycled background, animation pretty much anything that does not fit or you have seen before.Sound- nothing to talk aboutOverall: The story like the first episode is hard to follow along. The only stories you can follow along well with are the side stories. Although, that could mainly be due to the fact that while seeing this one has seen the originals to what these stories are influenced by. Furthermore, one would know what to expect. Lastly, the comedy is a joke in itself. The puns and liners they use are childish antics like farting. The only reason why i gave this a 4 as apposed to a lower rating is it was interesting idea to see real movies in cartoon form with a sex theme. Although, that bike idea i would say trash it for it really was a confusing element. At least i would if it wasn't a key foundation to the show.;Not Recommended

0;Golden Batman;Arsene_Lucifer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arsene_Lucifer;4;Golden Batman is a Korean animated movie from 1979 based on a 1967 anime series called Golden Bat or Ogon Bat in Japanese. Created by Takeo Nagamatsu in the 1930s, Ogon Bat is a Japanese superhero that predates the likes of Superman, and Batman. Much to my surprise, Ogon Bat is considered to be the world’s first superhero. Borrowing more traits from Superman than the name of the 1979 film would imply having super powers that include superhuman strength, invulnerability, and the ability to fly. In the original Korean-Japanese production of the 1960s anime series (according to what little information could be found on this series), Golden Bat is apparently the last surviving Atlantean who fights crime wearing a golden skull mask. If you see the poster, or promotional art you’ll notice that the golden skull mask is nowhere in sight. Turns out in 1979 Golden Bat design was updated to resemble Batman.Now, the only viewable copy of Golden Batman is a Spanish dub of the film since the film never officially received an international release in the US. Probably because the new character designs rips off Batman. You either have to search to the ends of the world to find an old VHS tape, or search desperately online. If Golden Batman was dubbed in any other language besides English, or Spanish that would be the end of the story. There’s no English subtitles either so unless you know you're Korean, or Spanish well you're sadly out of luck. However, that is not the case for me so I’ll discuss the actual film.Golden Batman (or Black Star vs. Golden Bat according to the announcer in the beginning of the film) story follows a bunch of kids, and their talking pet dog trying to prove their bravery for their dying sick friend. There’s also a subplot revolving around villain Black Star who is kidnapping the world’s top scientists to develop a weapon that can make him take over the world. Pass the opening credit sequence which has cheesy music the first thing the villain, Black Star, is shown doing is watching a news broadcast. This news broadcast basically clarifies a scientist is working on “Rocket TM” which is described to be a robot for an Aerospace Science Central. Black Star after seeing the newscast decides to call the Aerospace Corporation, and announces to them in a phone call that he’s planning to steal the blueprints to “Rocket TM”. With this information you think the Aerospace Science Central would signal Golden Bat, or sing his Korean theme song to make sure Golden Bat appears at the scene in advance to stop Black Star. The Aerospace Science Central does not do that, and instead a army of clone security guards that were in charge of protecting “Rocket TM” fear at the sight of Black Star.This event make news waves where whoever translated the script into Spanish felt the news broadcast should say (paraphrasing) “We’re living in a time of authentic danger”. Leading me to speculate that regular crime committed by normal people in this world is not considered “authentic danger”. There’s also a pointless cutaway to a child crying where the mom threaten her kid she’ll call Black Star if he doesn’t stop crying. It contributes nothing to the story, but that some hilarious cruel parenting right there. It only takes around six minutes before Golden Bat actually makes first his appearance in the film for some further nonsense. Aside from his ridiculous character design the members of the mafia show their fear by doing some sort of invisible orgy from what I could interpret from the animation. You got one mafioso thrusting the air, and another mafioso thrusting the floor repeatedly. This leads into a badly animated action scene where Golden Bat wins easily. After stripping the mafia down to their underwear, and leaving one of them a red Bat on their chest Golden Bat leaves the scene. So why did Golden Bat go to the hideout of the mafia if it wasn’t to retrieve the blueprints is never explained. Well, Golden Bat is did strip down several mafioso down to their underwear so he had a plan of some sort that wasn’t aimed at kids (the film intended demographic).This goofy fight while entertaining sadly isn’t followed up on. Instead of following the last surviving Atlean fighting evil on Earth the film shifts focus to a bunch of annoying kids that really like Golden Bat for the majority of the film. Given the film is barely an hour, and ten minutes long the kids remain static characters. Along with the one dimensional kids, neither do Golden Bat, or the villain Black Star have much personality to them than stating the obvious between good, or evil. The movie also has a easy to follow story where you’re just meant to accept everything at face value. There’s a talking Cat, and a talking Dog that wears boxing glove in the film that everyone simply accept in their everyday normal life in this world. In one scene, there’s a kid who disguises himself as Golden Bat to scare off the mafia, yet the disguise changes his height, body structure, and voice simultaneously. I could buy the mafia falling for the disguise, and even Golden Bat flying out of a Lava pit unscrathed, but an entire costume changing a kid body structure is just pushing it.Among various nonsense of the writing there is Toltry (the main character) father who claims it is normal for his son to break his neighbor windows. I bring this up because the film does this frequently. It shows something to the viewer that is inconsequential to the story, and goes about it business like nothing happen. So for like 40 minutes it does this until eventually the kids discover Black Star cave by accident. The film tries to setup drama by having a sick dying kid in the film, and revealing his tragic backstory through flashback. I laughed at this part in the film so that tells you how much I cared. Not only was the currently sick kid bald for some reason when his mother died, but became good friends with neighborhood kids on a whim. I would have taken the scene seriously if what sounded like bad porno music (the bad voice acting didn’t help either) wasn’t playing in the background during the flashback. Also, in the flashback a kid shed tears, and his tears goes through his glasses. That’s the kind of things you’ll notice when boring kids character are meant to carry an entire film. It’s difficult to care them too when they’re idiots. In one scene, Toltry tells his friend they should leave before they are discover by Black Star henchman. Instead of immediately leaving the evil layer the kids stand in the same place until an announcement finishes saying someone entered the evil headquarters. I know Toltry is the same character is who did animal impression to cheer up his dying friend in an earlier scene, but that was seriously stupid.The best part of the movie is easily whenever Golden Bat appears on screen because ridiculous things happen on screen. It’s a shame he’s delegated into the background since the climax is the highlight in the movie. During the climax, the film could care less about the tiny details like logic, and rational thinking as Golden Bat beats up everyone in his path. Golden Bat fights against an army of clone henchman, a robot, and eventually the villain with just whatever came up to the animators mind. Golden Bat is so powerful that he even survives falling into a pit of Lava, and flies out of it without a scratch to fight the villain of the film. The final confrontation is entertaining seeing Golden Bat fight a villain who can seemingly shoots laser out of anything he touches. If the movie offered more cheesy superheroes antics over annoying kids than the film would have been more enjoyable, though probably just as badly written. It would make the moment where Golden Bat karate chops off Black Star arm off look less out of place given the intended audience was obviously for kids.Animation is odd. Unfortunately I was unsuccessful in finding the studio behind this film. Then again I guess it’s for the best since the animators have a clear butt fetish in the film. Characters are slapped in the butt, kick in the butt, patted on the butt, and a couple of shots to show fat kid butt. Putting some detail into them which questions where the animators priority were at. Throughout the film there’s many examples of bad animation like a character face being colored differently from the rest of his body, a kid head going through a bed sheet even he’s a couple feet away from it, and Golden Bat flying off seemingly out of thin air from a window. My favorite pieces of bad animation is the constant jittering from all the characters in the film that never stops. It’s quite an accomplishment when the animation is so bad that still animation wasn’t done properly. However, the non stop jittering of characters make can scenes unintentionally funny when taken out of context. Usually making it seems like characters are doing something sexual like making it appear like a fat kid is giving his dog a rough time.The character designs are basically bland. Golden Bat character design is baffling. It looks like Batman, but the combination of blue, red, and yellow in this film strikes fear in the enemy's heart. His cape is blue on the outside, but red on the inside. He has a red Bat on the front which looks ugly the yellow suit, and blue everything else looking very ugly. Backgrounds are okay for the time it came out. Unfortunately without much action in the movie the animation doesn’t provide much to look at.I saw the film with a Spanish dub, and regardless of what language you actually understand you can obviously tell this is horrible voice acting. Now I can’t list any specific voice actors since the credits are written in Korean, and the Spanish dub didn’t list any Spanish voice actors in the closing credits either. The only voice actor I would give any compliment to is whoever voiced Golden Bat did a good job in his role. His role was rather limited in screen time, but the voice actor felt self-aware of the role he was playing, and chose to ham it up. It felt appropriate with the tone of the film. Golden Bat was also the only voice actor whose performance was remotely enjoyable because he was intentionally campy. Even though Golden Bat was the hero the evil laugh of Golden Bat as he beats up people is hard not to enjoy. Every other voice actors was terrible. The whole cast simply not caring about their performances. The only things that aren’t dubbed in Spanish are the Korean song tracks. Including two moments where the kids sing Golden Bat theme in their original Korean language, and oh man it’s awful! The kids are out of sync, can’t sing those high notes, and also can’t sing.Golden Batman is an interesting piece of animation history, as well the source material it's based on, but there’s nothing to see here. Golden Bat takes a back seat in his own movie even though he has top billing in the film title. While unintentionally funny in parts the annoying voice acting, and the amount of time it likes to waste on pointless diversion it’s better to leave this relic of the past unseen.;Not Recommended

While Osamu Tezuka is rightfully remembered as the father of manga, there is far less appreciation for Kenzo Masaoka. Back in the 1930s, Masaoka was inspired by the work of Walt Disney and Max Fleischer to create cartoons depicting traditional Japanese folklore. Masaoka not only introduced sound to anime for the first time, but also introduced the concept of cel animation. Masaoka's apprentice was Mitsuyo Seo, who created the first full length anime film: Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors. It was this film that inspired young Osamu Tezuka to learn art and start telling stories of his own!The plot of the film is simple, since this is only around 10 minutes. It starts with the famous 12th century samurai, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, training under the tengu at the foot of Mt. Kurama. Minamoto then fights an epic duel against the warrior monk Benkei. This is the first action anime ever made and it looks pretty good for 1939! It's actually better than Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors from 1945, but this had the advantage of being shorter and not being made in the death throes of WW2.Art:In this film, we can see Masaoka is still being heavily influenced by American animation. It isn't really until his 1946 anime Sakura that Masaoka becomes confortable with his own style. The animation is relatively smooth for a 1939 cartoon. It's not Snow White, but this was made on a budget.Overall:It can easily be argued that without Masaoka there would be no Seo. Without Seo there wouldn't be Tezuka and without Tezuka, anime as we know it wouldn't exist. Masaoka is the grandfather of all anime and this is one of his better early works that still exists. Sadly, many of his early works were lost due to the bombing campaigns of WW2. If you're interested in early anime history, this short film is essential!";Recommended

It not only gives you a good representation of who we can thank for where we are today, but also how far we've come. With that said, here is a bit of a review.Story: 6 Without spoiling it, it's another historical animation, with a bit of good action and a story that you will at least find a bit interesting.Art: 7 It might seem weird giving this a 7, but for 1939, you've got to consider the limitations, and how what you are watching isn't so much about the shine or the sparkles, but about making something fun and interesting within the limitations allotted.Sound: 6 There was some skipping, but so what, have you seen some of the Anime today? There are some messed up voice acting in those as well, and what is their excuse?Character: 7 A rather likable ""hero-ish"" character that was someone you could understand more if you'd watched it back then and from the country where the source material was made. Otherwise, he is a character that you can at least root for.Enjoyment: 5 Although it is fun to see how far we've come, it isn't going to blow you away. It felt like a history lesson, fun for those who love history and wish to learn more about how we got here, but also a bit dull after realizing how far we can still go haha.Overall: 6 Again, worth the watch, if anything to be more grateful for the anime we have today. But if you go in expecting to learn something and still have a decent story, you won't be disappointed!";Mixed Feelings
0;Benkei tai Ushiwaka;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;4;This is not Kenzou Masaoka's best work, even for its time. After the delightful Nonsense Story : Monkey Island, this unfinished work seems rather unpolished in both tonality and consistency. It has a very strong start with incredible detail in both the density of art, clarity of frames and fluidity of movement of the characters, but quickly loses consistency and steam once the crows appear.The sword choreography is both simple but delightful to watch. The flexibility of the animated medium to employ swift and unrealistic object transformations is used to good effect to create visual gags that seem heavily inspired from both western animations like Disney and dominant silent film tropes - a la Charlie Chaplin's tramp.There's no particularly gripping narrative here. It is just an exploration of how the animation medium lends itself to the dominant media trends when it came to action at the time. Folklore is mixed in with an emphasis on the belief in traditions and elderly guidance, but looking for anything deeper would be an exercise in futility.Considering how short it is, there's no harm in giving this a watch - but it by no means is a necessary watch. I suggest the Tora-chan series or Cherry Blossom - Spring Fantasy as a better entry in this historical figure in the Japanese animation scene.;Not Recommended

0;Ginga Reppuu Baxingar;Inter_anime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Inter_anime;4;"No one else has written a review for this anime, so I guess I’ll be the first one. Ginga Reppuu Baxingar is a space action-adventure mecha from the early 80s, involving a bunch of galactic vigilantes on motorcycles going around the solar system kicking ass. I encountered this by random one day and out of general interest checked it out.The story involves Shirou Mahoroba aka ""Billy The Shot"" and his friends known as the “Cosmo Rangers” going around bringing justice to the universe. They eventually are hired by the overarching government or Bakufu. They go around riding motorcycles, and when a really big threat comes up their motorcycles all join together to form a big mecha called Baxingar. There’s usually some villain introduced at the beginning of each episode whose out for revenge or betraying them or something and by the episode they meet, and the bad guys are defeated. Apparently the plot is based around the warring states period in Japanese history, but you don’t need to know that to follow along.If there’s one thing I can praise this show is the art and character design. Each character is unique and distinctive, and they also all have at least a change of clothing and style at least once each throughout the show, no small feat in the 80s where everything was hand designed and drawn. Aside from that the background art and fight scenes were decent, the music was pretty over the top and corny, and often didn't fit the scene at all. The characters themselves were mostly one-dimensional and meh. Some of the characters faces were drawn pretty consistently, but some of the other ones, especially the female background characters, were drawn so poorly it bordered on body horror.The plot and technology of the show is very inconsistent, one moment they fighting with guns, then swords, then magical space motorcycles, and then giant mecha. They keep switching it up every scene and it gets somewhat stupid, and you will pretty soon be asking why they don’t just pull out their mecha to win every fight if it is so invincible. In one of the dumbest twists, one of the characters goes blind midway through the series, but this surprisingly has no effect whatsoever on his fighting abilities or the plot, he just develops some random 6th sense.Did you think storm-troopers had bad aim? You haven’t seen nothing yet, as even the mooks of Star Wars look like expert marksmen compared to the villains of Ginga Reppuu Baxingar. Despite the fact that all the fights take place in close combat, whether using sword, gun, or mecha the bad guys hit thin air nearly every time while our protagonist always take them out with one shot. It isn’t until episode 19 in fact that one of our main characters is hit, and even then it is just a flesh wound that he easily shakes off. To make matters worse, this overabundance of plot armor is completely reversed in the last three episodes, were the main characters start dropping like rocks in situations they had been escaping without a scratch.Probably the worst part of Ginga Reppuu Baxingar, and it is really bad, is the writing. The script is hilariously terrible at being subtle, so bad in fact that by just the first five minutes of an episode you can already tell with 99% certainty how it will end. For example, episode 8 has a soldier being told by his girlfriend “I love you so much boyfriend, please don’t die”. I’ll leave it up to you to figure out how the episode ends. Episode 18 has a soldier being told by his sister “I love you so much brother, please don’t die.” Guess what happens again. In Episode 38, man get’s told by finance “I’m glad you’re still alvei.” No one could have predicted what would happen in the very next scene. Episode 10 has one of the main characters think out loud “It’s the anniversary that my whole family was murdered but they’ve never caught the killer.” Do you know who she meets by the end of the episode? This goes on and on and it goes from being pretty fun to really annoying by the end.So in conclusion would you enjoy Ginga Reppuu Baxingar? Every episode is action packed, even if that action is pretty nonsensical, and there are good aspects. Despite that, a lot of the anime is painfully average or bellow average, and even among other cheesy 80s anime it doesn’t really stand out. There are a lot of similar mecha anime that came out during the same time and are better.";Not Recommended
0;Huang Yan;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;8;"This donghua has quite the interesting setting. It's set in a modern or near future setting, and focuses on many psychological and societal issues that are now part of our lives because of what our world has become. The plot revolves around a low self-esteem, ""ugly"" young women who is bullied and judge because of her looks. She is depressed, in a self-destructive relationship and even turns to self harm as a way of coping. Eventually she overhears of some truths she has been intentionally convincing herself is not true, and so turns to plastic surgery to try to start life anew. Unfortunately, there is no reset button or new game option, as the past can never truly be washed away. Through this experience she grows as a person, finds that she is not as alone as she thought, and finally embraces both her past, mistakes and takes a step forward without being controlled by the opinion of others.This donghua was very enjoyable. It really targets many issues that stem from modern technology, modern society (like social media), bullying, and depression. It even touches on corruption and manipulation of public opinion by the powerful (or rich). This show is a great critique of our current modern society and what is wrong with it.The show itself presents a good message for us: we should know the sanctity of life, and no matter how hard it is, we can work past it and grow as a person. (Also, we should not be overly conscious of others' opinions).";Recommended
1;Huang Yan;Khashishi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Khashishi;10;"I'm going to have to put this up there with Link Click and Mo Dao Zu Shi as shining masterpieces of donghua. I was left after the end with that clammy empty feeling when all emotions are completely wrung out. This is criminally underrated at 6.72 at this time. I can only imagine it is due to a strong bias against donghua and against 3D CGI, and against adult drama in favor of pretty fight scenes. (The stats show a very anormal distribution. This is probably due to dishonest voting.) The visuals here are not the strong point, but I think people rate visuals too highly. The screenplay, story and direction is pretty much flawless.The story remains tense and nail-biting over the entire series. Nearly every episode feels like a cliff-hanger, and the unease never really goes away even during the most peaceful or romantic parts. It doesn't feel cheap, because the direction is such that the tone is very consistent and there is a lot of foreshadowing. It is incredibly well-paced, always on edge. Though the episodes are short, there is enough development of characters and plot-lines that it does not feel rushed.I love the character development on both the MC Han Yuxi and the doctor Ling Huantao. Han is at times timid and at times resolute, and it makes her feel like a full human, and makes her even more brave (bravery isn't the absence of fear, but when you are afraid and determined anyway). She grows as she faces challenges and through introspection. Doctor Ling is a complex character who can't be reduced into a hero or a villain.The donghua is chock full of social commentary, without compromising the hero's story. Some parts are obvious as given in a speech by the MC, but some is up to the viewer's interpretation. Is Han living a lie by changing herself, or she asserting control of her own life? It's important to have a good view of yourself and not only look at what others see you as. But that doesn't mean you can completely ignore what others think.The animation is not bad, but does detract from the overall quality of the work. Unfortunately, the 3D models aren't able to convey the same level of emotion through their movements as live-action. I'm not quite sure why they didn't make this a live-action, as it does feel more appropriate for this kind of work. Maybe filling a cast with similar looking beauties would have been hard. I think that the semi-realistic 3D style used here is definitely a better match for this story than some 2D bishoujo style, because the 3D style gives it a certain verisimilitude which makes the story feel more real and scary rather than fantastical. Some of the shading looks too plastic, and some of the backgrounds look too simple, which detracts a little. It doesn't look as good as something like Yuan Long. But it's leagues better than Berserk.The soundtrack is amazing. The OP and ED play pieces of the same song, which is both extremely unnerving and exhilarating, and it is blended into the episode seamlessly such that the emotional effect of the story combines with the powerful song. A portion of the song will play during the episode. The story-boarding must have been very clever to reach that compatibility. Several other songs play, like a beautiful insert song ""Love You"", the soulful ""茧"", the powerful ""來者是我"". They stand alone well but also fit the theme of the story. Quite packed for a short series.";Recommended

This one's longer, actually feature-length at 47 minutes, and drags a bit accordingly; the first half is more talky than I'd like, and the world is a bit less vibrant than the likes of ""Pink"" or either of Toriyama's mainworks (Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, if you somehow don't know). Still, when this gets going, it GETS GOING.If I recall correctly, ""Dragon of Konpei Island"" as a manga was essentially the prototype pilot episode for what would become Dragon Ball, and you get a whole lot of similarities here. Martial arts super kids, a smart young lady, an evil eccentric army out looking for a prized orb... it's very Dragon Ball-esque. And, thanks to an bubble economy-level budget, even this direct-to-video movie has some incredibly impressive fight scenes. They're fun to watch and very dynamic; very good stuff.I wouldn't say this is anything ""super special you gotta watch it,"" but if this is in your wheelhouse, you'll have a good time.";Recommended
1;Kosuke-sama Rikimaru-sama: Konpeitou no Ryuu;Black60Dragon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Black60Dragon;7;If you don't already know, this was an early anime film by Akira Toriyama, best known for being the creator of Dr. Slump and Dragon Ball, with this film sharing many elements with the latter.The premise of the story follows these two characters Kosuke and Rikimaru, who are the guardians of Konpei Island whose job it is to protect the last living dragon from harm. Partway through the film's villains (who share a strong resemblance to the Red Ribbon Army) show up to steal the jewel from the dragon which leads to a huge fight scene. The final battle against the main antagonist, Michael Commando (who shares a heavy resemblance to Commander Black) is honestly quite enjoyable with many great action scenes that look like they're straight out of early Dragon Ball.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this. If you're a fan of Dragon Ball, or martial arts anime in general, then I definitely recommend at least giving this one watch-through as you won't be disappointed.;Recommended
0;Ginga Shippuu Sasuraiger;The_Namer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/The_Namer;6;"Sasuraiger might hold the record for the western anime release to go out of print the fastest, being available for less than a month before Discotek discontinued the J9 Trilogy of which this is the final series (though no prior knowledge of the other two shows is required, since they're only a trilogy in a loose sense). So the questions fans of 80s mecha shows may be asking themselves are: should you be kicking yourself for missing out, and is it worth paying horrific scalper prices for? Read on and draw your own conclusions.The premise is interesting in theory: turn Around the World in 80 Days into Around the Solar System in 365 Days, then throw in a train that transforms into a giant robot. In practice, the execution is variable. Despite being tasked with travelling to 50 planets (they do eventually explain why the solar system has that many by the 30th Century), it often feels more like a road trip across 20th Century America, with a few stops in the wild west and planets inspired by other countries. There are times when Sasuraiger goes full space opera, and those tend to be fun, but on the whole it suffers from a lack of imagination.The characters are an atypical bunch for an 80s super robot show. There's no Earth Defence Force here, and not a Japanese name in sight. You know that one outgoing, happy-go-lucky and perpetually cheerful American character that used to show up in 80s and 90s anime a lot? Everyone in Sasuraiger is like that. They're constantly throwing each other a thumbs up, and ""Yay!"" is their version of the Thunderbirds' FAB. Maybe this is just what Japanese people think all westerners are like. You'd think this would grate on the nerves after a while, but surprisingly it works.Sasuraiger's strongest episodes tend to be those highlighting individual members of the JJ9 team taking part in the journey. Everyone seems to have half a dozen different tragic backstories, since they keep running into ghosts from their past everywhere they go. Thanks to these episodes, and the JJ9 team's infectiously upbeat personalities, Sasuraiger was a show that grew on me after its shaky first few episodes.Unfortunately far too many of the other episodes fall into one of two predictable patterns. Either:a) The JJ9 team land on a planet where there's local unrest. They're immediately held up by a gang of thugs with machineguns who capture them and either try to blackmail them into doing something illegal or threaten to hand them over to series villain Bloody God (the kind of villain who remains permanently concealed in shadow even when he's standing next to normally lit people in direct sunlight). JJ9 escape, transform the train into Sasuraiger and kick their butts.orb) The JJ9 team land on a planet where there's local unrest. They're immediately held up by local law enforcement, who blame them for crimes that happened before they arrived on the planet and arrest them. JJ9 escape, transform the train into Sasuraiger and kick the butts of whoever really committed the crime.As for the action, it's a mixed bag. There are some good battles and chases, but in general the Sasuraiger is too over-powered for the typical thugs to stand a chance against it. The enemies don't even start wheeling out their own mechs until half way through the series. Up to that point the hero mech is just stomping on cars and tanks that might as well be toys. After a lengthy transformation sequence, Sasuraiger often lays waste to the opposition all too easily. Also, for a super robot show, it's oddly low-key about fetishising its titular mech. It has various weapons, but they're deployed with no fanfare; I couldn't tell you the name of a single one of its attacks. It may have been trying to ride the line between super robot and real robot a bit, but considering that it's basically a transforming Galaxy Express 999 it's definitely a super robot.The series does reach a satisfying conclusion, and I waver on whether it's a 6 or 7 overall. It's a show I chipped away at over several months, but ultimately enjoyed and will probably watch again. In the end though, the mediocre episodes outnumber the good ones. There's the backbone of a solid 26 episode series scattered throughout Sasuraiger's run, but the other episodes that pad it out to 43 weigh it down.";Mixed Feelings

0;Kaze no Matasaburou;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;7;"A decent children's story appropriate for bedtime, featuring the voices of Mayumi Tanaka (Saburou) and C.W. Nicol (Narrator).Based on a story by author Kenji Miyazawa, the plot basically follows the synopsis above: a mysterious red-haired boy, Saburou Takada, starts attending a rural school, and his appearance and actions pique the curiosity of his fellow students, one of whom insists that Saburou is actually a wind god from an old legend. After their initial reluctance to get to know him, the kids eventually befriend and play with Saburou, and then an incident occurs that reaffirms the main kid's belief that Saburou is indeed the wind god. At the end, Saburou leaves the school just as suddenly as he came... like the wind.The animation style is unique in that it is limited and the characters look almost like cardboard cutouts moving against a stationary background most of the time. This, coupled with the narration, gives this OVA a storybook feel. The backgrounds tend to be vague and abstract. The characters' faces, in my opinion, aren't pleasant to look at; the kids are kind of ugly, and Saburou looks a little scary/evil. But that's just part of the style.The music is nice, and both lyrics and composition fit the story well. Interestingly, there's a scene in which a rendition of ""Camptown Races"" starts playing, which caught me by surprise, but the context somewhat fits.As for the voices, Saburou is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka, but that might be hard to catch because Saburou doesn't have that many lines. In fact, most of the characters don't have too many lines, except for the narrator, voiced by Welsh-Japanese author and environmentalist C.W. Nicol. Most of the other characters are not voiced by professional voice actors, and it shows -- the performances are lacking, especially the teacher, whose delivery sounds decidedly wooden.Since this is short, there are some questions left unanswered, but maybe they don't get answered in the original story, either. However, it is structurally, aurally and visually decent enough to watch.";Recommended

0;Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru 2;zeruon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/zeruon;6;"Mashin Eiyuuden Wartaru is a franchise, wich includes several anime series. All have in common that the brave and more or less (but increasingly) distinct saviour and hero Ikusabe Wataru fights evil in his mighty fighting robot. This is the second season of the franchise, which was broadcasted a half year after the end of the first season. In the meantime, the anime Madou King Granzort had been shown in the same timeslot.The basic structure of this season is the same as its prequel: The world is split into seven levels, in each of which a final boss as well as one stage boss for each episode await the hero to be heroically defeated. Only very few side quests distract the hero from this path and helpful characters will make sure to excplain him the next goal of the main quest. Shibaraku and and Himiko accompany him on his quest while other friends from the first season join in later. A around the half of the episodes, some budget seems to have appeared in the studio and gets allocated into character development and story building. After not much happened for over 20 episodes, quickly all characters get some backstory thrown at them for some actual story telling to commence. By this, the end of the series feels a little bit rushed, while the first half felt even more insubstancial than some parts of the first season. All in all however it is still entertaining thorughout all episodes and builds up the expectations that are fulfilled with the OVA ""Owarinaki Toki no Monogatari"".The experience of the magical Soukaizan realm is well underlined by beauiful backgrounds and atomspherical music. In many fighting scenes however, frames are heavily reused and the quality of art heavily varies with the importance of the scene. Although the exclusive use of songs by the band a・chi-a・chi, which is certainly an integral part of the marketing strategy, makes me sometimes feel a lack of variation, all opening and ending songs fit perfectly with the style of the series and are accompanied by good animation. The background music is mostly unobtrusive, only some songs might have been used a little bit less often.Most main characters where already introduced in the first season. Umihiko is the only notable new main character, I did however enjoy him very much. At first he seems to be quite similar to Toraou, he is however very unique and the only character with a majour backstory. (Umihiko, I love you<3) The other characters are further developed, especially by their relationships. Wataru seems to have grown in confidence and Himiko sometimes behaves even more ignorant of her environment than she already did before, does however also show some development of slowly becoming more mature. Although Shibaraku recieves some character development, he stays a sidekick more than any other character. Kurama (Mr. Bird) is mostly developed in his relationship with Umihiko and Toraou became to have a strong friendship with Wataru, did however not lose his original behaviour.Although the first half of this series only progresses very slowly, it has its funny moments and still portraits a colourful realm of adventure. Enduring the first half is then rewarded with the so far best part of the franchise and while the end leaves several open questions, you will certainly not regret watching this childish, cool and interesting adventure.Please watch the successing OVA, it is very good and gives the franchise a great finale.

Reader, it is not. How's the music? A fan of vaporwave might enjoy it, but to the average viewer, the synths provide nothing special. Character designs? They're okay, but nothing a regular anime-watcher hasn't seen before. All in all, this is a middle-of-the-road effort.Being just a scant 2 episodes, those curious about it can consume the whole series in half a lazy afternoon, but might walk away wishing they'd watched something else.";Not Recommended

0;Jack to Mame no Ki (OVA);Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;6;Rate a 6English SubtitlesPlotA good children's story. Although while it is interesting to watch the moral of the story is iffy. I mean there are perceived morals but most of them are bad. The few that are good are faintly hinted at like take care of your family and/or know the value of items. Even than those two good principles were kind of hypocritical at least in portraying of the main character that was suppose to be teaching them.I will explain... if you were a kid and you were given a task that was of high importance for it contained a huge impact on your family one better take that decision to heart. For a mistake of any kind can be HUGE. Rather that doing that task another task was done instead. Sure both had good intentions but the complete disregard of family and task was also done. Luckily the good out weighed the bad at the end but what if it hadn't? What if the second hand deal was even worse with no good aspect? Family is screwed, the kid is in trouble and the future for both is bleak at best. Not to neglect to mention the second backhand deal scenario went against the good concept of stranger danger.ArtI think there was promise with the character design of all white but sadly the artist(s) didn't mix the design in a perfect fashion. Yes, the way it is currently is unique but aside from being slightly unpleasant to look at they didn't take advantage of what they had. For example for those that did not view the film the main character and his family looked kind of like light bulbs. If the son remained white and his mom remained yellow not only would that make for easier character distinguishment but you are presenting a physical element of change. For when the main character, a kid achieves success he could turn yellow himself to show enlightenment.;Mixed Feelings
0;SeeIn AO;ThatRandomDude;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ThatRandomDude;7;"There was a time back in the golden age of anime... where Hentai and visual novel authors actually put effort into making something original and decent ""porn with plot"", intead of imitating and using the same formula over and over again.It was in the 1990s and early 2000;SeeIn Ao is one of them. This 'hentai', if we could call it that, feels more like an R-rated drama love story than an actual hentai. Episode one actually looked hentai ish on the sex scenes but episode 2 looked more like borderline hentai/soft porn. I say this because episode one actually showed genitals while episode 2 it was done with little glances; and they empathized more on the drama than the actual sex scenes.SeeIn AO has two arcs done by same episode and yes, both do connect.The Male protagonist is Kyoya, a guy who left his home town after graduating from marine biology and joined the research faculty located on a remote island-city.First episode/Arc centers around Miyu and Yumi, two supposed twins sisters that went orphan after their parents died in 'an accident'.Miyu has a crush on Kyoya after he saves her life from drowning and Yumi helps her sister, which she adores and devotes to, realize her love... but Yumi has a deep secret that Miyu does not know...Second episode/Arc, we dive in into Kyoya's past and the reason why he left his family. His little sister, who is actually his step sister after their parents remarried, came to stay with him after their mother was moving for reasons i dont remember. But the real reason is that Yui, the little sister, wanted to be with her big brother to help him heal after their long lost; and wanting to declare her love for him in the process telling him that he is not alone in carrying the heavy burden about their mutual older sister who died of a heart attack since she had a weak heart after they taking a trip together to the sea.I actually did not felt aroused by this film but actually felt intrigued. In my eyes I could see it as just another R rated film about romance, drama and the bonds of family than just some mere porn to jack off. And for that I am really satisfied.Its unfortunate that hentai of now days don't try anymore to be decent and put effort into it and just imitates the same stereotype formula over and over.And its a shame that not many people actually appreciate the effort of people in the 90s put into making something decent.The animation also was decent for traditional creation and the heroines were cute and down to earth.This film was enjoyable.";Recommended

0;Maid Meshimase;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;2;Oh god. This animation... it's so cheap. Everything barely even moves, dialogue is barely even synced up. Not to mention the drawings, which are also super simplistic. There was barely any detail on anything, and it all just looked so bland. I wouldn't be surprised if the budget for this thing was a ¥100 coin and a pack of smokes.The story is equally as bad. A maid-for-hire mistakenly goes to this young man's house, thinking it was a different house. After the young man tricks her into thinking she has the right house, he invites her in, and he realizes that she was supposed to be meeting an erotic novelist.So, he comes up with the most convoluted plan and as she's cleaning under a table (not wearing any panties, by the way) he wraps his laptop's cord around her leg and says that there's a manuscript on there, and if she moves too much that she'll unplug it and the data will be erased.Things go on like this for a while and he keeps making the stupidest, lamest excuses and inevitably tricks her into having sex with him. I thought this was kind of funny, but also really dumb. It's not like the writing itself is funny, it's just so stupid that you can't help but laugh at it.The audio is really low quality. It sounds like it was dubbed on a tape deck using some really shitty quality microphones. The quality of the acting itself isn't very good either, but it's about on par with what you'd expect from a pretty low rent hentai.The sex scenes themselves are kind of bland, due to the really cheap looking animation, but I do give the actors credit for really giving it their all despite a lack of very much movement during the scenes.Overall, this was mildly enjoyable, just due to the really stupid dialogue. However... every other part of it is pretty poorly done.;Not Recommended

0;Gendai Kibunroku Kaii Monogatari;IzzyMarrie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IzzyMarrie;6;Normally, I don't write reviews, but seeing as there's not enough ratings to even show a score, and that there's no reviews, I feel I need to. So far, this is the only Ga-nime I have ever seen. The artwork is incredible, and with the voice acting and incredible soundscape, I'm happy to say that this was a 46 minutes well spent.I rated this as highly as I did because of the uniqueness and enjoyment factor for myself. Please note that I was unable to watch this with English subs, and so this is going off of atmosphere and art alone.I'd say it leans more on the unnerving more than anything, but it's still a fantastic watch for anyone curious enough and who may enjoy unique and odd horror artwork. I wouldn't say that it ever got really grotesque, but it's definitely got personality and is very unique.The ending score was really surprising as it was in English and a highly energetic, almost chaotic theme that almost seemed forced. If I had to make a complaint, it'd definitely be the abruptness of the ending theme. After the final story, it just hit like a train lol And the singer was kind of... not good. The instrumental, though, was decent.In regards to the animation, there is none. It's essentially a slideshow of really interesting artwork. I was afraid that with 46 minutes, that maybe there'd be long moments of narration over a single image, but it never felt like one image was up on the screen for too long.I didn't know what exactly to rate the story or the characters seeing as the only way I was able to watch this was in Japanese with no English subtitles. However, that didn't deter my enjoyment. It did leave me disappointed as I'd have LOVED to know what's going on. I'm actually planning to eventually purchase a copy of this OVA, and maybe Toei released it with subs.All in all, this definitely won't be for everyone, but it might be worth checking out. I hope this review helps someone!;Mixed Feelings
0;Akichi Asobi: Playground;ZLB;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ZLB;8;This is a story about friendship. There is no actual dialogue except through writing and action. There is a clear beginning, middle, and end which satisfies the viewer''s needs of closure. The art is soft and the movement is not very smooth due to stylistic choice. It was easy to tell the difference between the characters. The art added to the childishness of the characters and the beauty of their developing friendship.The music was not outstanding or horrible. It was amazing due to the fact that I barely noticed it. The sound effects sometimes took full control and when there was a more dramatic scene, the music lifted with some piano and drum jazz.The characters were clearly different from the start of the story, and by the end they had changed significantly. The two characters seemed to be of two different places in their class's social setting, where one is popular while the other is rather a lone wolf. Both come out with a realization and they have clear character development.Overall, the enjoyment of this anime is an 8 because it was a little slow, and I was a bit bored towards the end, but the ending gave fulfillment.I would definitely recommend this if you are a little bored and want to take a small five minute break from life.;Recommended
0;Friends: Mononoke Shima no Naki;poppi-the-witch;https://myanimelist.net/profile/poppi-the-witch;10;Allow me to inform you of a seemingly overlooked gem in the anime community. Time and time again I have watched children movies from Japan, and time and time again they astound me with how well-done they are. While some are talked about (Magic Tree House, One Stormy Night) and others are rarely brought to the West (Oblivion Island) this is the first one I have watched where I couldn't find anyone talking about it. Barely any information on MAL and not a single comment to be seen on tumblr or other similar sites. I find this sad.Friends: Mononoke Shima no Naki (Naki of Monster Island) is a fun, emotional, and heart-warming movie. I can loosely compare the plot to Monsters Inc., where a young child is left with a couple of monsters who try to send it home and in the process develop caring feelings for it.200 years ago, monsters and humans were at war, and the monsters were driven to a different island where there numbers have diminished significantly. Humans are more afraid of them than ever and never dare go to the island, where monsters never dare go to the human island in fear that what little is left of their population would be massacred. However, one day, a young boy goes to pick mushrooms from the trove of them the monster island has. After a couple of monsters chase him down, he desperately escapes, leaving his younger brother, Kotake.We are then introduced to the two main characters, Naki and Gunjo, who lost their parents in the Human Vs. Monster war and consider humans to be terrible beasts. They handle the child in exchange for sole rights to the mushrooms for a year. The story simply takes off from there, and becomes an enjoyable and emotional ride.The animation can be a little stiff, especially more obscure background characters. However, overall, the animation is very good quality. The scenery of the islands, and the stark contrast between them, really shows in a beautiful display of colors and atmosphere. Facial expressions are also done very well.The soundtrack is quite amazing. I would definitely have every track from the movie on my computer if it weren't for a lack of places to find it. The music really sets the mood of any given scene. Sounds effects are executed nicely, and the voice acting is superb.The characters are where the movie shines the most. Seeing Naki's character development over the course of the movie is touching, as well as his relationship with Gunjo. Gunjo is a fun character and by the end of the movie will tug at your heartstrings. These two alone make the movie worthwhile, but their development and interactions with Kotake and the other monsters on the island, as well as humans later on, is really well-done and written excellently.Overall, this movie is a shining gem, as are most movies from Japan aimed at children in my personal opinion. I urge everyone to give this movie a try and spread the word. Maybe even if you don't like it someone you know will.;Recommended
0;Fortune Quest: Yo ni mo Shiawase na Boukensha-tachi;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;5;Fortune Quest: Yo ni mo Shiawase na Boukensha-tachi is a JC staff anime based off of an eight volume light novel. It also has a SNES game, which you can't avoid knowing about if you watch the anime because they have a segment in the middle of every episode where they have a joke advert and then a real advert for the SNES game. And JC Staff is one of those studios that can hit lofty heights with the likes of Yami no Matsuei & Flying Witch and also mine the crustiest excrement with works like Shakugan no Shana or Garzey no Tsubasa. But hey, at least they've never made anything as horrendous as Evangelion. They've also had quite a few mediocre works. So, let's see where this one happens to land.Story:We open with our heroes having some financial problems. They decide to try and get a quest, which they can't pay for. So, they offer the quest giver a deal. He'll get a percentage of the profits from any treasure they find (he'll be disappointed when the RNG ends up with them finding a wooden dagger, a used condom and a Solid Snake Dakimakura with stains in odd spots) in exchange for the quest. He agrees, but first he gives them some simple work to get them out of debt. All they have to do is fetch some hot spring water. Before you can say “something will definitely go askew” things go wrong and the group finds themselves with a far more difficult job than they imagined. Who could have foreseen this besides everyone?The big issue with the series is simply that a lot of it is rather predictable. There might be one twist that you won't see coming a mile away. Most of the events that happen are just so bog standard that they're really obvious if you have any experience with fantasy works. Another issue is that the OVA is meant to be comedic but it's not all that funny. The jokes are just mundane.That being said, the OVA does have a strong aesthetic sense. It does manage to capture the whole “old school D&D inspired RPG” feel pretty nicely. And it does capture your attention pretty successfully. Don't imagine it could maintain that if it were much longer, but with four episodes it can manage.Characters:There isn't much to say about the cast. Clay is the leader. Pastel is the good, caring woman. Trapp is the one who causes friction. Knoll is the gentle giant. Rumy is the childish one. Kitton is the amnesiac who, oddly enough, knows the most about adventuring. Okay, let's be fair to the others. He only knows how to handle the shit they encounter because he carries a strategy guide. Oh, and the antagonist is basically motivated by boredom. I know how he feels. I always build doomsday devices and hold the world for ransom when my Internet goes down.Art:The OVA doesn't look bad. It's not good looking either. The action sequences are a bit lazy and the character designs aren't very interesting. They look like someone was trying to make the most generic D&D characters they could, except without the Drizzt clone because literally everyone hates the person who plays as a Drizzt clone. About the only exception is Shiro. He looks like a cuter, more canine version of Nall from Lunar Silver Star. Except this came out first, so I guess I should be saying Nall looks like a less cute, more feline version of Shiro. I actually do like Shiro's design.Sound:I can't really complain about the acting. They got some good people like Touma Yumi, Canna Nobutoshi, Nishihara Kumiko & Furukawa Toshio. I don't think anyone is going to point to this OVA as the best performance in any of their careers but they're perfectly capable. The music is all right.Ho-yay:There really isn't any. Maybe the series could develop some if the characters had compelling or somewhat complex interactions with one another, but that is not the case. It would have to be betwixt the lads, though, since there are only two major female characters and one is a child.Final Thoughts:Fortune Quest is not a bad series. If you're really starving for something short of the fantasy persuasion, it might serve you. But there are a lot of better fantasy comedies out there. JC Staff has been involved with at least two franchises that fit that description. The Slayers & Mahou Senshi Louie. That being said, it's not bad either. And there are probably as many fantasy franchises that are worse than it as there are better. So, again, if you're really desperate it probably won't be intolerable by any degree. For myself, I give it an indifferent 5/10. Next week, Witch Hunter Robin.;Mixed Feelings
0;Paris no Isabelle;Tyumace;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tyumace;7;When I was a child my uncle told me that when he was in college, he and his roommates, after a milk puking accident and a series of subsequent lab experiments, had discovered cheese. He told me that the only reason he’s not being paid licensing fees from all over the world, is because filling in the form to file his patent seemed like too much work at the time. In hindsight I can clearly tell this was a lie. I mean, my uncle went to college in the early 80s, but this anime from the late 70s has cheese written all over it. It was upon realizing this however, that my mind went in a completely different direction. Reader, may I ask you: have you ever seen a cheesy 70s anime? I hadn’t before this point. Surely some old-fags stumbled into some cheesy nonsense back in the day, some over the top super robot shows or whatnot, but the 70s shows that newer anime fans are getting into are usually a little too tasteful to put on a cracker half its own thickness. The only reason why I even watched this show is because Old castle, a group that had already subbed a few classic shoujo before this, had just started subbing this when I discovered them. Little would I know what a crazy ride I was in for. I don’t think they knew either.In a way it almost makes too much sense: but a couple months before ‘A Rose of Versailles’ would hit television, one of the most iconic, classic anime of all time, based on an already popular manga and set during the early days of the French revolution, this anime would come out, set during a much shorter, much less well known French revolution, and just so, this anime would be much shorter and much more forgotten. Does it deserve to be forgotten? Well, kinda. I don’t think anyone is going to watch this anime and come out of it lamenting the fact that more people don’t know about it. But anyone who does delve into it, thinking it’s going to be boring and only barely coherently watchable, is likely to be pleasantly surprised.Before World War 1 there were but two examples of major, modern warfare: The American Civil War and the Franco Prussian War of 1870. It is often argued that the nation states of Europe at the onset of the Great War wrongfully looked at the latter of these two conflicts to figure out what war was going to be like in the 20th century. Despite that, though this war seemed like any old war of glory on the German side, the French didn’t experience it this way and this anime is not afraid to show the horrors of modern warfare and to quench the fantasy of glory. Despite being a somewhat silly show, its setting is filled with bloody battlefields, angry populations and corrupt nobles. The silliness of the show comes from the fact that this serious war drama is held up by a backbone of cheesy, girly drama and a bit of fun, over the top, boyish action.Considering the amount of historical young adult novels from the seventies I read as a kid, all of which were about tomboyish main characters, I feel right at home watching this show. Isabelle is all I could dare ask for as the main character of a show like this. Right at the intersection between childhood and adulthood, Isabelle is finally starting to appreciate the value of femininity, yet right when she finally wishes to join noble society Paris is disturbed by the nearing of an enemy German army and her family is almost torn apart. What makes her work so well is the fact that she is a very tough cookie. She doesn’t cower away in the corner when something dangerous is happening, but actively participates in the action. She stands up for what she cares for and is not shy for sharing her opinions, but she’s still somewhat naive at times. In the second half of the show she goes on an adventure with her weakling of a side-kick Jean and her chemistry with him is a lot of what makes the show for me.Similarly to A Rose of Versailles the beginning part of this show forgoes the military conflict at hand for courtly melodrama, which might put off some people. Just like in Versailles, I do think this part of the show goes on a bit too long, which is strange, because the rest of the show is constantly moving. The rest of the show goes from action bit to action bit, from location to location, never lingering in any location for too long before moving to the next and that’s probably what kept it fun for me. There were a few parts of the show that got me kinda bored, but it always picked back up pretty quickly and despite the low production quality, the action was usually pretty exciting. The action wasn’t all the same stuff either. There were parts where they ran away from the Prussian army, there were sword fights, there was an action scene in a balloon, they had everything. There were parts where an immortal, unintelligent Frankenstein’s monster went after them and just wouldn’t die, goddammit!. You know... all the regular action movie stuff.The production quality is probably the wonkiest part of this already super wonky production. There’s a lot of awkward of even downright bad looking shots in this show and the fact that it manages to make the action work despite that is pretty impressive. Because this is a seventies show, however, the way that it is wonky is completely different from a modern show that’s made of a shoestring budget consisting of whatever coins they could find in the directors couch. Modern shows often save their animation effort for scenes that deserve it. Even high budget shows will often look somewhat stale outside of action scenes. Maybe you’d get a few head bobs here or there, but modern anime rarely go through the trouble of animating something inane, like pulling back a chair. But seventies anime do that sort of stuff all the time, even when the animation comes out looking like it was someone’s first cut they ever drew. And I have to give my respect for that. Sure a modern anime might use what it has more effectively, but it’s nice sometimes to see small stuff like that being animated and to see animation being spread out over the episode. Even if that means we also get to see lots of awkward cuts, wonky perspective shots and one shot where the left half of some guy’s face looked like it belonged to another person... Oh God what have they done to that poor old man’s face?!The music on the other hand is pretty good. Half the score consists of piano tunes by Chopin, which I instantly recognized, because I had just watched Piano no Mori when I was watching the show, which has an entire season-and-a-half long arc about a Chopin piano competition. The other half of the score is generic anime orchestral music, which, I have to say, was pretty darn good. There were a few moments in this show where I went: “Hey, this music is pretty good”, which I’d be pretty proud of if some random guy on the internet said that about a piece of music that I made 40 years ago. Nothing is greater than having a scene be elevated by the selection of a good, fitting tune, rather than the background music being there for the sake of itself and this show nails that, sometimes. Also the show has two openings: one for the show and one for the block. And the OP for the block doesn’t fit the tone of the show at all. Ya gotta love that.So I started writing this review, about a month ago, with a whole sketch about how cheesy it was. And yeah, depending on your definition of the word ‘dairy’ this show is pretty cheesy in a quite few ways, but, like, I don’t actually have anything to say about that. There were times where I was enjoying the fact that the show was so silly more that the show itself, but there were also parts where the show was genuinely moving or exciting. Even if the show is more shaky than my body after I do five push-ups, it still manages to do a lot of things right to make up for its failures. I honestly wasn’t expecting to give this show anything higher than a 6 when I went into it, but it really hustled for its money. Whenever I was getting bored it tried something different, every time I thought the show was out of tricks something insane happened. And it’s short too, only 13 episodes. It’s not super hard to pick this show up on a whim, spend an afternoon watching it and come out of it thinking: “huh, yeah. That random mal reviewer was right. This show really is slightly better than expected.”Anyways I’m gonna go back to doing what I was doing before, which is listening to the Aikatsu song ‘Love Game’ on repeat, which I was already doing, but I’m gonna continue doing that now Bye.;Recommended
1;Paris no Isabelle;RetroAnimeMike;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RetroAnimeMike;7;"Few people have heard of Isabelle of Paris, and not without reason. In fact, I am convinced that if it was not for the cultic Rose of Versailles manga getting its just as cultic anime adaptation that same year, noone would have bothered making this show. But it was made and their inspiration is evident: the heroine of both shows is a woman stepping outside the confines of what is seen as proper behaviour by taking on a more active and vocal role in their own lives and public events, going as far as fighting with a sword etc. Both have a love interest who has been present since childhood. But the tone and structure of the two tragedies differ so much, only the location of Paris and the period of major turmoil termed a revolution is what stays the same.The problem with Isabelle is firstly that they don't dwell on the story at large, but only move from point A to B and in this all characters are secondary to the plot; everybody merely reacts to events, the story is fragmented and lacks cohesion or a proper theme. It is also drawn poorly and animated in a bad way. When there's dancing, they skip frames but the wrong ones so the legs just teleport about weirdly. Even the title card wears the name Isabell [sic] where the two letters L are given in different typefaces. However the many action scenes can be entertaining; a good few feature a minor character named Karlov, a la Boris Karloff of old Hollywood monster movie fame. This is when it becomes clear that this is in fact the kind of cartoon where it is only natural that the antagonist has a clearly green face.But where the show is strongest is melodramatic tragedy - dynamic and colourful still panes slowly moving across the screen as Chopin plays with great virtuosity! I do not joke, the still pane is an art, and Isabelle uses it well. But that is all. Our heroine is just a girl from Paris who survives all these turbulent and tragic events, without a proper story of her own. She isn't a great sword-wielding hero, nor a cunning spy, not even a rebellious youth who takes on the establishment or the patriarchy - other, also episodal characters more readily take on these roles. So in retrospect, Isabelle tried to tell the grand story of revolution and loss, but couldn't decide who's story to tell. And here we are with all these events that don't really make a story. But this is a short series - you can watch it before you watch Rose of Versailles, it will make you appreciate it more. Watching it after only made Isabelle look worse in comparison.";Recommended
0;Wan Jie Shen Zhu 2nd Season;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;6;Following the capture of the Queen of Snow God Country, Ye Chen is still a target of many gods. He discovers avatars of the Fire God King have descended onto the Blue Planet to reincarnate the body of the Fire God King. Simultaneously, the Void God King and his entourage plots against Ye Chen to become the next Successor of God Blazing Temple all the while Queen of Snow God Country's younger sister fights against captivity in a dream world and Ye Chen unlocking and reinstating his deity from the God Blazing Temple in order to fight against the old Teacher of Northern Bei Di Country.Story: 6/10Season 2 of Lord of the Universe is pretty much a replication of Season 1 where the problem is shown in the beginning of some gods plotting to eliminate Ye Chen because of his position as Lord of the Universe. Slowly but surely, after spending around 30 episodes exploring and discovering relics and allies he has a big fight at the end where he defeats his opponent with overwhelming victory. Except in Season 2, instead of the enemy being the Queen of Snow God Country and fire god King its the old head of state of the Northern Bei Di and instead of the eternal armor and dragon/million year devouring spirit Ye Chen obtains Fire god King's avatars and a red Qilin as his subordinates. Essentially, the story is repeated with different enemies and different subordinate so the plot development is unchanged from the first season.Art & Sound: 6/10- No Comment -Character: 4/10Character development is probably tanked from the first season. Ye Chen's connectivity to the Universe softens his heart so that he trusts literally anyone. This is also why character development doesn't progress at all in the 48 episodes of Season 2 - Characters betray his trust left and right even in the end many of his subordinates trust is wavering. This kind of character development is lazy and uninspiring because it shows there is no value in the characters of this series.Enjoyment: 6/10The series wasn't too bad but at this rate I feel the series is heading in the same direction Wu Geng Ji is with its repetitive plot and character development.

In an age when animation wasn't really part of mainstream culture, this short was made to illustrate the problem of war and power, and if you allow yourself some freedom of imagination, you can see that these chickens that produce eggs and profit for their master while receiving nothing in return but what is necessary for them to stay alive are in fact a good proxy for the working class. Ladies and gentleman, this is an early form of activist art, it might be a bit basic in its execution but the idea is spot on. Anime isn't just hyped fight scenes and cute girls.;Recommended

0;What's Michael?;eyepatchie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/eyepatchie;3;"""What's Michael?"" is a collection of 3-4 minute shorts about cats. The concept sounds quite cute, I enjoy older animation (when it's done well), and I like cats, so I thought it might be a decent watch.But nahhh. The art and animation is mostly fine, so no complaints there. The problem is that it's not funny. Almost every short in ""What's Michael?"" is either unfunny or uncomfortable, sometimes both. Didn't really wanna see cats being slapped / punched, didn't really wanna see an adult cat be inappropriate towards a kitten. Just felt gross.I'm not sure who the target demographic for this is. If you like cats, you don't want to see them hurt... If you hate cats, you don't want to watch an hour-long OVA about cats... Baffling.Among the many bad shorts, there's a couple that were fine, but that being said I wouldn't recommend ""What's Michael?"" to anyone. It's not worth suffering through all the bad shorts for the one or two that you might find funny. There's many, many better uses of your time.";Not Recommended
0;Gigi Goegoe Sunghyungsoo;Deago;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Deago;8;"Beauty Water is a loose movie adaptation of the popular South Korean Naver Webtoon 'Tales of the Unusual', which was written by Seong-dae, an author who drew inspiration from the work of the renowned writer Itou Junji. Known for his strange and eerie tales that go beyond the horror genre, Itou Junji's influence can be seen in Beauty Water as well. Despite the movie's positive reception in South Korea, it has not gained much recognition outside of the country due to limited international marketing efforts. As a result, many audiences may be missing out on the unique and captivating narrative that Beauty Water has to offer.It is a rarity to come across anime that authentically and realistically depict the social problems that women face in their everyday lives. While some anime series, such as .hack//Sign and Welcome to the N.H.K., have done an admirable job of highlighting social issues, they remain few and far between. .hack//Sign, for instance, explores the topic of escapism through online video games, which is a problem that many people, including women, face in the modern world. Meanwhile, Welcome to the N.H.K. tackles the universal struggle of transitioning to adulthood, a topic that is relatable to both men and women. However, they are not specifically gender-focused, which means that the issues presented within them can be applied to both men and women. While this is not a problem in and of itself, it is important to recognise that women face unique social issues that are different from those faced by men. As a result, there is a growing need for more works of fiction that focus specifically on women's issues and that provide a platform for their voices to be heard. Only then can we begin to truly understand the complexities of the issues women face and work towards meaningful solutions.'Boys don't cry, girls don't climb trees'Throughout human history, there has been a gendered expectation of what it means to be feminine or masculine. Men are expected to conform to ideals of emotional control, financial independence, and muscularity, while women are expected to embody virtues such as elegance, grace, attractiveness, and beauty. The social pressure to conform to these gendered ideals can be particularly difficult for young people, who often lack a broader perspective on life and may feel pressured to adopt certain behaviors or appearances in order to meet society's expectations. For women in particular, there is often an added layer of insecurity surrounding appearance that can make them more susceptible to exploitative messages from the media and advertisers. Advertisers and media outlets often perpetuate unrealistic and harmful beauty standards, leading to a culture that places excessive value on physical appearance. Women are often bombarded with messages that reinforce these ideals and can lead to a variety of negative outcomes, including eating disorders, body dysmorphia, and low self-esteem.Beauty Water is a thought-provoking social commentary that delves into various issues surrounding beauty. One of the key messages of the movie is how beauty can be used as a tool for achieving fame and wealth, which can result in a society that values appearance over substance. We see examples of this in our reality such as 'gold diggers', 'Twitch thots', and celebrities who have gained success solely based on their appearance, despite lacking any actual talent. This is a common phenomenon in the anime community as well, where many female characters are often judged primarily based on their physical appearance. This is evident in the way that many popular anime series tend to have a significant focus on fan service, or sexualised depictions of characters.Conversly, the movie also highlights the dark side of beauty and how society often mistreats those who do not meet its unrealistic beauty standards. Women, in particular, can become victims of social prejudice, bullying, and discrimination based on their appearance, which can have long-lasting psychological effects, this unfair treatment may even last from elementary school to adulthood. Being a victim of social prejudice for being ugly from a young age can be very psychologically damaging to a female individual, so a woman's obsession with pursuing beauty, despite knowing the cost and consequences, may appear justified. This can be seen in Yaeji's character, who faced social prejudice for being 'ugly' since she was a child, which drove her to become obsessed with her appearance as a means of improving her social and economic standing, losing sight of her true career, and ironically becoming a make up artist, believing that beauty is the only way to improve her socioeconomic standing. This character arc highlights the damaging effects of society's obsession with beauty and the toll it can take on an individual's mental health. Additionally, the movie touches upon the issue of Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a mental health condition that is commonly found in young adults and teenagers. The symptoms of this disorder include spending too much time in front of the mirror, excessive grooming, wearing certain clothes to hide flaws, and in extreme cases, it can lead to the individual developing social anxiety and avoiding public activities due to shame and embarrassment. Throughout the movie, all of which aforementioned symptoms are exhibited by Yaeji.'I just want to be loved' — YaejiThe movie deliberately employs bizarre unrealism and surrealism to emphasise the extreme and often absurd lengths people will go to in order to meet society's beauty standards. By employing these techniques, the movie is able to criticise advertisers and celebrities for promoting unrealistic beauty standards, as well as the cosmetic industry for capitalising on people's insecurities to sell overpriced and often ineffective products. The titular 'Beauty Water' is a prime example of this critique; an expensive miraculous cosmetic solution product that allegedly makes one beautiful 'with no side effects', which was an obvious symoblism to plastic surgery and liposuction, promoting the idea that beauty can be achieved effortlessly and without consequences. With this symbolism, the movie highlights the potential economic, societal, and mental costs associated with the pursuit of physical beauty, especially for those who aren't mentally stable to begin with or who are ill-prepared.In fact, South Korea has one of the highest rates of plastic surgery in the world, and it is often viewed as a means to achieve social and professional success. In South Korean society, physical attractiveness is highly valued, and people who are considered unattractive may be discriminated against in various aspects of life, including employment, education, and even social relationships. As a result, many people, particularly women, feel pressure to undergo cosmetic surgery to improve their appearance and increase their chances of success. This issue is not limited to South Korea, as discrimination based on physical appearance is a global issue. Many women around the world feel the need to change their appearance to meet societal standards and achieve success. In fact, the beauty industry is a multi-billion dollar global industry, and the media often promotes unrealistic beauty standards that can contribute to low self-esteem and body image issues among women. The character of Yaeji in Beauty Water is a reflection of these societal pressures and the unrealistic beauty standards that many women face; there are real-life women from all around the world who are unhappy with their appearances and believe that changing their appearances will lead to career advancement, so even if you despise Yaeji for her immature behaviours, Yaeji is a relatable character for many women who feel the pressure to conform to societal beauty standards, we can't deny how realistic her personality is and how easy it is to empathise with her.Beauty Water uses a unique combination of 2D and 3D CGI animation, while the environments and objects are beautifully animated, the characters, except for some background characters, are mostly 3D animated, which may not appeal to fans of traditional 2D animation. The colour palette in Beauty Water is vibrant and eye-catching, with an ability to shift from light and bright to dark and moody, depending on the tone of the scene. The use of colours also effectively conveys the themes and messages of the movie; such as the vibrant pink hues emphasising the focus on femininity and beauty. However, the animation quality can be inconsistent, and some may find it lacking in detail and fluidity, especially in the few action sequences. It is worth noting that Beauty Water is not a big-budget animated movie; it is 'ugly', so it is unfair to expect it to on par with the likes of the 'beautiful' Disney or Pixar movies. However, the visuals are not the movie's strongest aspect, and those who are particularly sensitive to poor ugly animation and art may find it difficult to enjoy the movie.At first glance, Beauty Water may appear to be an innocent movie due to its art style, but in reality, it is an adult film with graphic violence, mature themes, horrific scenes, and nudity. The movie does not shy away from exploring darker themes such as the societal pressure for women to conform to beauty standards and the consequences of such pressure. While works of a similar nature often fall into the romance genre, present idealistic views and other shoujo manga tropes, Beauty Water manages to stand out by conveying a pessimistic message, although the movie includes elements of romance and generic shoujo tropes, its focus on social issues from darker perspective sets itself apart. Instead of offering solutions or preaching about right and wrong, the movie simply acknowledges the unfairness of life and leaves it up to the viewer to deal with it. This approach may not be for everyone, as some viewers may prefer a more uplifting or positive message in their movies.While Beauty Water's unique blend of animation and its message may be its strengths, this movie is not without its flaws, it heavily relies on cliches and misused character tropes, which was disappointing. The secondary cast of characters, in particular, are often one-dimensional archetypes, lacking depth and complexity. We see characters like the 'beautiful outside but cruel inside', the 'mother's boy', 'the musclehead' and the 'horny perverts and molesters'. Luckly, the movie does a decent job of allocating screentime between characters. The more important the character, the more screentime they get, which helps to keep the focus on the protagonist and her psychological journey. In fact, the movie's character-driven narrative is its strongest asset, it is not just about the themes, but also about how the protagonist deals with them and how she is affected by them.Whilst it may be easy to view and interpret the movie as a criticism of plastic surgery, I believe that this is not entirely the case; the movie recognises that in a society where beauty is linked to social and economic status, plastic surgery can have advantages. However, it also serves as a warning that plastic surgery is not a panacea. For instance, Yaeji inflicts pain and suffering on those around her, including herself, not because she undergoes cosmetic changes, but because she mistakenly believes that such alterations will solve all her problems. Beauty Water effectively delivers a message that may resonate with individuals who view plastic surgery as the sole solution to their problems, as the movie's underlying message is that transforming one's appearance does not necessarily lead to a change in personality. The story's central character, Yaeji, goes through a cosmatic change to conform to society's beauty standards and improve her socioeconomic standing. However, despite her new look, she still struggles with the same internal conflicts and problems she had before the procedures.While the movie touches on related themes such as the impact of social media, celebrity culture, and commercialism in the beauty industry, these topics are not fully explored. Nevertheless, it is understandable that the movie's duration of 85 minutes may not have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of these themes without negatively impacting the pacing of the movie. The premise is a fascinating one that delves into the connection between beauty and self, and it is a testament to the writer's skill that the story is relevant not just in South Korea, but globally. The movie's exploration of the societal pressure to conform to unrealistic beauty standards is a topic that resonates with many individuals, regardless of their country or culture. The premise sheds light on a variety of related social issues that stem from society's expectations of the individual, these expectations are not just limited to physical appearance but extend to inner beauty as well; society places a great deal of pressure on individuals to be 'good' or morally upright, and this can be a difficult expectation to fulfill as moral relativism is a collective and ever-changing concept. The movie's examination of beauty as societal pressure is only an example of societal expectations on individuals, this pressure to conform can manifest in a variety of ways, including mental health issues, social isolation, and low self-esteem, it also raises important questions about the societal pressure to conform and the negative consequences that can result from this pressure, which may encourage individuals to look beyond societal expectations and to focus on developing their own unique sense of self.Overall, Beauty Water uses surrealism and unrealism with horror to make a strong statement about the unrealistic and often harmful expectations placed on individuals, particularly women, to meet society's beauty standards. It also serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of plastic surgery and the importance of self-acceptance, and encourages you to question these beauty standards and to prioritise their mental and physical health over their appearance, it highlights the message that a person's true beauty comes from within and that physical alterations are not a solution to underlying problems. The pacing of was well-done, as the movie managed to keep me engaged without ever feeling sluggish or rushed. I was never bored throughout the movie, and the strategic use of foreshadowing was effective in preventing plot conveniences or 'asspulls' that can feel forced or unearned. But what I appreciated most about Beauty Water was its focus on exploring meaningful themes rather than relying on mindless entertainment or horror. The movie's thoughtful examination of self-image, societal expectations, and cosmetic surgery provided a thought-provoking viewing experience. In summary, it was an excellent example of how anime can be used to tell engaging stories while also exploring complex themes, the movie presents these themes in an engaging and thought-provoking manner, making it hidden gem and a must-watch for individuals who may be contemplating plastic surgery or struggling with self-image issues. I hope to see more anime like this in the future, which prioritises substance over spectacle, and encourages viewers to reflect on their own relationships with their self-image and self-worth.";Recommended

0;Hibari no Yadogae;blindfremen;https://myanimelist.net/profile/blindfremen;2;"Made in 1933, Hibari no Yadogae (""The Larks' Moving Day"") was a low budget, short adaptation of one of Aesop's Fables (The Lark and the Farmer). The purpose of these early Japanese animations was to educate children through entertainment, with various easy-to-tell moral messages regarding proper behavior, values, and ethics of society. The new film medium was later turned on its head and exploited by the Japanese military in the 1940's for propaganda purposes.As for The Lark's Moving Day, the message is short and simple: ""Self-help is the best help."" Depending on others to complete a task is not enough if you are not willing to take things in hand yourself.This short really suffers from poor production values and (I'm assuming) technological restrictions. The novelty of low FPS black and white animation wore off quickly and all that was left was the story. Lack of character names or personalities, stilted pacing, and a bland style dragged the show down considerably. That said, it did have a story, a message, and it was short.If you want to learn about Aesop's Fables or other folk lore, I would recommend simply reading them.";Not Recommended

That's one telling sign of a good work of art.In terms of both content and execution, the movie is exactly where it wants to be at any given moment. In the five short minutes of its runtime it takes you on a *wild* ride, building up tension that erupts in a massive pay-off that is both deeply emotional and viciously clever, but it never feels forced or exploitative. Like a good dish, it immediately traps you in and leaves you invigorated and deeply satisfied. Instead of thinking ""okay, next"", you want to stop there and savor the taste. You've just consumed something delicious; you liked it not because of its nutritional quality, nor because it was small enough not to cause inconvenience—you liked it because it was a quality dish in its own right. Director Tetsuro Kodama is most certainly a chef, and Pianoman is his unique recipe.All things considered, it's easily one of the best movies I've seen, regardless of the length.(P.S. You can skip the trailer. It functions as a sort of a prequel, but I don't think it adds anything to the story.)";Recommended

On the outset a divisive genre, and even more so being as it only ever results in masterpieces or swill, rarely an in-between.Pianoman is the latter. I commend the team behind it for trying, and I think it's great they got the opportunity to, but it really is awful. If five minutes is still too long to waste, approach with caution.----There's nothing to say on the story front. It's what the synopsis says, and that's about it. Nothing of meaning happens throughout the short, and by the end there's literally no change. Considering the heavy use of music, its practically an AMV with a few voice lines now and then.The same can be said of character, it's devoid. There is a single man, he interacts with some instruments. He doesn't have a personality other than being a bit confused to start with. While a decent arc could do the trick to make him interesting, there isn't one. By the end of Pianoman, said man is exactly the same as he began.----With technical aspects the peaks of the ONA can be found. The animation is pretty good, with some very nice shots near the middle and end. The art of Pianoman is also reasonable, giving a detailed, realistic style to the protagonist, while a more stylised, ""fairytale"" look to the various creatures that apparate as the piece goes on. The music is rather strong, being a single arrangement that flows unfaltered and that harmonises with the in-scene music the protagonist plays.That's about all the praise I can give, as when it comes to the world and tone, it's a huge step down. Not a lot can be done when setting a piece in White Void (tm), and not a lot is. There are two set pieces, one of which is only ever observed from a distance, and the other is just to break the monotony of the floor for a bit. Neither are used in an interesting manner, especially the latter. There's something of an attempt with growing plantlife that blooms, but it doesn't really have a conclusion or a clear meaning, so it doesn't land at all.----When laid out, it's clear the biggest problem is the short being pointless. If there is a story to tell, Echoes didn't manage to, and if there isn't then why did they even bother in the first place.I normally try to spend this point suggesting ways I'd allay its issues, but just as the short says, ""there is nothing for [me] here.""

Art-wise, it appears as an advanced student film, I suppose, but the character looks really, really dumb with the torn sleeves, and there is a clumsiness to the whole fiasco that leads to nausea.

The animations are fluid and organic, the art/designs are nice. And the story premise is quite good, however, if you look at it from an adaptation perspective, it really leaves much to be desired. There are simply too many changes to the plot to really be called an adaptation. I saw one commenter on Youtube say it is only kept the name the same, most everything else has been changed. It was given the Yuan Long Season 2 treatment.For the changes, they seem intent on reducing the number of characters in this donghua from the original. The princess was originally insufferable (she made me want to throw my computer out the window pretty much every chapter, but later disappears so it made things better), but now she's less annoying and more normal(?), and she seems to be the main focus/FMC for now, which was NEVER THE CASE in the novel. I might write a more detailed review later after this full season is released.All in all, I think it's worth watching as a standalone work, but might not be if you loved the original novel and expect an accurate adaptation.Adaptation Score (how faithful to the source): 3/10****************************************************************This will be a more comprehensive review of Shen Mu after I finished watching the whole season.

The following review may contain spoilers.For the Shen Mu donghua, if you look at it as a standalone work (not as an adaptation), it is still a decent donghua, though a bit light-hearted and generic. It is not a bad watch, however, the tone and direction is much different from the original work (novel).General Plot: Chen Nan wakes up 10,000 years after his death (he remembers dying), to find himself in a tomb where all the most powerful figures of his time buried alongside him. He wonders, why is he alive? After finding out about how much time has passed, he originally plans to look for some answers and live his life exploring this new work, but an unexpected reunion with the HouYi bow, his family's heirloom divine weapon drags him into the conspirisies planned for tens of thousands of years.As a standalone work, the story and plot of this decent. Unfortunately, because this is an adaptation that had a huge departure from the source material (more on that in the adaptation section), there are large amount of inconsistancies in both character and plot. However, despite these problems, this donghua story is still good, it is just not as well paced as it could have been and there is some questionable motives/decisions made by the characters. There is also an overly complicated romantic entanglement with a tsundere princess and political machinations (and clearly defined villain) that I felt were shoehorned in to create a huge climax for the season, espeically since the season ended most of the plot threads. Overall, it can be considered a relatively generic shounan donghua with a ""OP"" protagonist. Enjoyable, but very disappointing for viewers who read the original work.The character designs and the animations are done well, the art style is very appealing and the animations are smooth. The action scenes flow well and feel impactful. At least the animation department did a good job.Overall, an enjoyable watch, though the plot can be a bit incosistant and messy. 7/10Review as an adaptation (comparison to source, spoilers ahead):As for how this stands as an adaptation of the novel...........it's horrible. While it started off fine, the opening was pretty cool, it almost immediately began to change the plot; I thought it would only be small tweaks like most adaptations, but as the season progressed, the changes became greater and greater. By the end, it's even hard to call it an adaptation.Plot Explanation (SPOILERS FOR PLOT COMPARISON):Chen nan was originally a genius, a young master with great cultivation talent, but after his duel with Tantai Xuan, his cultivation started to regress to Rank 1 (from Rank 3). This caused others to treat him as a cripple/trash (typical). Because of this he was sent to travel the world to cure his depression by his parents, he met Yu Sheng during his travels, and the two fell in love with each other. However, he was later attacked by one of this father's enemies as revenge, during which Yu Sheng sacrificed herself to save him. While his father was able to go against the laws of nature to revive Yu Sheng, it was not perfect causing them to be seperated again. Chen Nan falls in to a depression again. Feeling tired of life, he goes on a deathmatch suicide mission to fight the son of the one who killed Yu Sheng. He dies and someone does something to his body (seen in the opening). Now we get to the beginning of the novel, where the donghua opens (All this was Chen Nan's history as is revealed later).PLOT OF NOVEL COVERED BY DONGHUA:Chen Nan wakes up 10k years after his death in the ""tomb of the gods"", a place where the most powerful people of his era were buried. After he ressurected, he left the tomb and traveled to a border town where he spent one year learning the new era's language (it has been 10k years after all). Then when he embarks on a journey to travel the new world, intending to start a new life unconnected to his past, since everything he knew had disappeared into the river of time. However, he has an unfortunate encounter with the princess Chu Yu, and ends up being captured as a slave (not servant like in the donghua) for peeking on her bathing. They continue to the mountain to get the fire lotus for the emperor's birthday present (not to cure her father like in the donghua). The princess uses the HouYi bow during the fight, which allows us readers to know understand the bow can only be shot once every 10 years (needs to recharge). During the fight, Chen Nan is able to escape, but is captured by the neighboring empire's prince as he tries to steal the HouYi bow that the princess snuck out. During the subsequent bluffing/ambush on the princess, the HouYi bow ends up in Chen Nan's hands as a ""hot potato"", with no choice, he is forced to try to use it to save himself, revealing he can use the bow without limitations. Then there is some plot revolving Chen Nan capturing the princess, princess taking a bite of the lotus, and reversing their captor-hostage roles. As punishment for capturing her, she uses that absorbtion technique on Chen Nan as punishment to weaken him, but ends up sucking all the Qi out of his body, revealing the hidden qi that caused his cultivation to decline. Because of this, others end up treating him as a cripple, while he is able to recover his cultivation talent and quickly return to the level he once was (he hid his cultivation from others and pretended to cripple). He hid his cultivation intending to not develop any ties with any powers, so he can remain free. The older princess manages to track the two down and decides to try to heal/nurture Chen Nan because of his ability to wield the HouYi bow, employing Nalan Ruoshui (a deleted character), a practicioner of medicine/healing arts. Chen Nan develops a close relationship with Nalan Ruoshui, since she's genuine to him. By now, his goal has changed, while he was intending to live a life free from his past, his reunion with the HouYi bow (a family heirloom), and revelation that his mortal enemy, Tantai Xuan has become revered, he decided to dig up the secrets of the past 10k years and get his revenge. To do that, he continued to hide his cultivation while he scoured the ancient books of the empire; once he finished he planned to leave (not to overstay his welcome as he is a ""cripple""). However, he learns that Nalan Ruoshui is to be married off in a political marriage (and live a lifetime of misery), he makes an irrational choice to reveal his power to prevent that, by officially tying himself with the empire. The emperor first agrees, then renegades, making Chen Nan mutiny. He finally is able to prevent the marriage through mutiny, and takes Chu Yu hostage in order to escape, ending the plot corresponding to the novel that the donghua should cover.The changes to the plot are numerous, but I will try to categorize them. The changes include: side character reduction and role consolidation, plot thread shortening and shuffling, political climate, and a plethroa of MC changes.Changes to the MC (character, motivations, etc.) -The MC was weak because of his cripple cultivation and not as ""badass"" as in this donghua. I guess this change was because most people don't like pathetic, self-loathing, and weak MC's, which he would have been for the first half of the season. His original motivation was to travel the world, then changed to learning the secrets of the past as his encounter with familar objects drew him into that vortex. He was also very independant and did not like to be attached to others, unlike what is shown in the donghua, as it seems Chu Yu, the princess, will be a mainstay in this donghua.Changes involving HouYi Bow -First in the donghua, the mysteries/secrets of HouYi bow came to light earlier, with the whole revival thing, this was something that was slowly revealed to readers as MC dug deeper into his past and found out about his family/clan's deeper secrets.Second, the HouYi bow was a divine weapon that protected the Chu Empire. Its ability was to guarantee a hit on anyone it was aimed at, making it an effective tool for intimidation (you would be able to effectively kill anyone you wanted which would scare other rulers), but it had a restriction: it could only be used once every 10 years, after that it had a cooldown because it had been sealed. This made the MC's value much greater, because he could pull it without that restriction (he's the defacto owner of the bow 10k years prior). Now, there was little reason to keep him by the first princess other than the second princess Chu Yu likes him (See character changes for more info).Side character Changes -The changes to the side characters are quite significant. The neighboring empire's prince was painted as the main villain and mastermind behind all the ""bad stuff"" in this donghua, while in the novel he was just a insignificant minor character. I won't say much about him because he is so insignificant, but his villainous portrayal is mirrored by the white-washing of the princesses (which I'll talk about a bit later).-The baby dragon that showed up in this season was only supposed to be introduced later in the story, during the academy arc, where the MC is headed after the end of Season 1. I guess they added it because it's cute and for comedic relief? The whole revalation that the dragon was a rank 5 dragon doesn't come until much much later; the reveal was quite premature.-Now onto the changes to the important persons of the empire: there was a significant amount put on the chopping block. The asshole dragon rider that got owned by Chen Nan (our MC) was basically a typical rich young master type. In this donghua, they changed him to be ""heroic"" and self-sacrificing even though he was a petty and selfish asshole.-When the MC joined the Eccentrics' brigade (where he stayed), he met some unique cultivators there, like the old poison devil and witch who were quite interesting and unique, but they got completely cut from the show.-There was a potential love interest, a friend of the elder princess named Nalan Ruoshui, who got completely deleted from the story. She was nice to the MC and would be one of the potential romantic interests in the story. After she was removed, her character and roles have been divided between the princesses (older and FMC).-The older princess is shown as patriotic/nationalistic and stern but loving in the donghua, however this is partially because of the role consolidation. In the novel, she is an perfect example of a cunning fox politician. She changes her face to suit whatever role she needed. She may act compassionate or understanding, but it is all calculated to achieve political goals. She even contemplated having the MC secretly assassinated after assigning him to some remote region after finding out he was useless, because her friend (mentioned above) had some good will/feelings toward him.-The FMC, Chu Yu, is changed to be a slightly mischivious and tsundere princess. In the novel, she was an spoiled, insufferable b*tch, petty and loved to watch the world burn for her entertainment. Chu Yu, the younger princess, was promoted to FMC, which was not the case in the novel. She was semi-important as a hostage in the earlier parts of the novel (for his protection after he mutinied against the Chu Empire), but after the academy arc Chu Yu mostlydisappears from the novel. Despite being a hostage, because the ancestor of the Chu Empire was following Chen Nan, he still had to deal with her annoying antics.Plot and plot thread changes -The main outline of the donghua is the same as in the novel, but because of changes to characters, the major details are changed. I also heard that there were production issues with this donghua (changing studios etc) which probably influenced some of the changes, like plot theards. This donghua is VERY episodic, meaning almost everything that happened in this season got wrapped up, with very little lead-ins for the next season (they only left . Some of the things that happened in this donghua were not supposed to occur yet, like they attempted takeover of Chen Nan's body, the reveal or introduction of the baby dragon. Those should have happened in the ""second arc"" which takes place at the academy they are travelling to at the end of the season. Because of all the changes to the characters, many of the details changed making this a very loose adaptation of the original work (novel).Political climate -The Chu empire, that the princesses are from was portrayed as one of the most powerful. Of course, the prince that is the main villain of this season, was trying to hurt the Chu empire by stealing the Hou Yi bow. The other empire was also powerful, on par with the Chu empire, it could simply be seen as a ""cold war"" for supremecy. In this donghua, the empire is portrayed as weakening, with succession issues, etc. While the vassal states wanted to show strength and break away from vassal status, it was not like how they were presented here (used by another country to achieve some goals).Final Adaptation Score (how faithful to source):2/10";Recommended
0;Tora-chan to Hanayome;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;8;The war has ended. Imperial Japan was dealt a catastrophic loss and American occupation had become just another fact of life as the restoration process had begun in full swing. Yet we see here dramatic undertones that reflect both the acceptance of the new reality that the Japanese were now beholden to Americans as well as the desire to rebel against the prescribed norms of the occupations.When the war was still in full swing, Japanese animators were still enthralled by the allure of western animation trends. Most works followed Disney's footsteps in both style and substance. It reflected the societal ambitions of the Japanese to become like these developed countries in every facet of life.Once the ego of the nation collapsed along with the end of the war, defeatism became a part of the reality. The fact that the marriage takes place in a church, the wealthy live in an American style suburban home instead of a traditional Japanese Minka as the aristocratic elite used to, reflects the acceptance of American intrusion into some very isolated Japanese lives.We see the grandfather speak about times changing. How marriages against the elder's wishes, once considered murderous sacrilege were now becoming an inevitable reality as feudalism began to recede into the shadows towards a more democratic political orderYet in the artistic direction we see a very urgent need to rebel. Art that used to copy the likes of Disney only a few years earlier were now beginning to incorporate elements of traditional Japanese art and local aesthetics into their animation. From the anthropomorphic cats to the the grandfather tiger, both in dressing sense as well as physical features, there's a definitive new aesthetic incorporated into this work of art.The story is deceptively simple on the surface, but deals with pretty complex themes. We are shown both the rapid divergence in mindsets of the prewar and post war generation, but also the Japanese society's desire to quickly adapt to this change and acceptance. From the beginning to end, we see the grandfather go through five stages of grief which are personified by the mischief of the two little kittens.The short also incorporates some excellent and very original visual gags. It's one thing I have noticed as I watch through the history of Japanese animation, is that the Japanese were very innovative at introducing innovative and out of the box visual gags and making beautiful use of the animated medium.It is lamentable that modern animation has lost this drive for innovation and settled for established and safe self referential tropes that pass for visual gags now. There are some incredibly poignant lessons in here for patrons of all arts to look for inspiration, to see not only how limits can be circumvented using traditional tools but also how simple stories can have brad thematic depth.;Recommended
0;Tora-chan to Hanayome;DerMensch24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DerMensch24;6;Tora-chan to Hanayome is one of two or three short anime involving our kitten duo that was created by Kenzou Masaoka, among one of his last works before retiring. Due to the shortness of this animation I'll be brief with my review.The anime makes itself out to be and by all means is intended for a children's audience, hence all the characters and the story are straight forward, slightly goofy, and basic. That being said, for a 1948 anime the animation quality is very much fluid, and to many may be reminiscent of an old Disney short from the same era. The sound quality is fair, however this may be subject to change depending on the source you are viewing it. I did get a good enjoyment out of watching a relic of the anime realm though. While by any means it does not compare to modern standards, this anime is still a decent watch, especially given the short run time.;Mixed Feelings
0;Pinky Street;dollie_mixtures;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dollie_mixtures;5;"Frankly, I'm surprised anyone would bother translating this; if you aren't familiar with Pinky:st, I don't know what interest or pleasure you'd derive from watching these two episodes.These short movies, not even 15 minutes long, were released singly on DVDs, each coming with a Pinky:st figure. And that was the sole reason for making of these movies, to plug the merchandise and appeal to the fan-base. The animation is decent enough and the 3D well done and cute, but the recycling of certain footage got old and made me roll my eyes. There is no time to develop a proper story or characters, hence it leaves you wondering why they even bothered. At least, the opening song is catchy and I find myself humming it often.I would only recommend it to Pinky:st figures' fans, and my score is really for them only; everyone else is better off looking elsewhere for entertainment.";Mixed Feelings
0;Funny Pets;CurlyFry;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CurlyFry;9;"Funny Pets is potentially the most bizarre show I've ever seen. It presents itself like a children's cartoon on the surface, but is actually an incredibly dark, morbid, surreal show. The juxtaposition of super childish content with extremely adult content (both violent and sexual) makes it a very weird, sometimes uncomfortable watch. This is definitely a ""you'll either love it or hate it"" type of show. I can understand why people would dislike it, but I would also look into what the show is before you write it off. I think there are two types of people who will enjoy this show. Some people will view it as a 'so-bad-it's-good' situation and enjoy it ironically. Others will sincerely enjoy it because it is completely unique, trying something new, and in my opinion, self-aware and succeeding. Definitely watch the first episode (it's only 6 minutes long). By the end, you'll know what the show is about, and you'll know if it's for you.";Recommended
0;Funny Pets;TheMAM;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheMAM;6;"Right off the bat, I'm going to assume you heard about this anime through director Masuda's underground cult-following hit, Popee the Performer.In the case you didn't, I'd recommend watching the masterpiece that is Popee the Performer instead and seeing if it's your cup of tea; and if it isn't, Funny Pets is probably not for you.In the case you did, if you're planning to go into this hoping to gain the same quality of entertainment as you did with Popee, you might be disappointed. HOWEVER, you would still get more of Masuda's crazy, creative world, albeit a different taste of it.This review will mostly focus on how this show compares to Popee the Performer.Story: (8/10)I see both Popee the Performer and Funny Pets sharing the same quality of story. That's because... the shows share almost the exact same plot progressions. While two aliens live under the same roof with a cute lady, one sun alien impresses her, the moon alien gets jealous and tries to one up him, mostly by resorting to extremes as violence and other psychics/reality defying escapades. Other plots involve what you'd expect: reality gets f***ed, they die an episode then come back the next, and a lot of violent things you'd never expect from a kid show happens. If Popee's story's what you're after, this fits right in.Art: (8/10)People like to criticize Popee and Funny Pets for the art style, but I feel as if Masuda's world could not have worked without it. It creeps to that level of uncanny valley while also avoiding to look like amateur 3D animation, and the facial expressions and bizarre moments play very well to the art style's favor. And at the very least, it is good enough to not be a distraction from what can be enjoyed from this show.Sound: (6/10)The music and sound effects did their purpose, but Popee did both these things subjectively better. I remember nothing of what I heard from this show in terms of music, as a lot of it tends to be relatively minimalistic with a few exceptions.Character: (3/10)THIS, I believe, is where Popee fans might get disappointed. The characters are husks. They are what the plot demands them to be. They will show primary traits, the lady character is dumb and pretty, the sun character is kind and also a boring God (so mostly he's discount Papi), and the moon character is Robbie Rotten from LazyTown (but mostly he's discount Popee), and the neighbors who I think might be moles are... just a family of scavenging moles.Sometimes the two aliens care for the lady, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the lady's sweet and smart enough to have ideas, sometimes she's apathetic, lacks basic depth perception and can't tell a corpse from the living. Sometimes the moon character will hunt the moles, sometimes he'll try and be nice to them. Point is, they are not very consistent, and to a certain extent, not as charming and creative.Enjoyment: (6/10)I wouldn't watch this again, I wouldn't really recommend it, but I was glad I saw it. It's more creativity and wackiness you'd come to expect from Masuda. The scenarios this man comes up with is unlike anything I've ever seen.Overall, this probably won't satisfy your Popee the Performer hunger, but considering one episode is only 4 minutes not including intro/outro, I'd say it's easy to digest and see whether it's for you or not. All episodes are available on Youtube, but good luck finding the second season other than from the DVD release, which I'd recommend, Masuda deserves it.";Mixed Feelings
0;Funny Pets;SigiltheBee;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SigiltheBee;1;Have you ever watched a massive dump for a few hours gather flies? I have. It’s called Funny Pets!Funny Pets is the tale of a sun thing and a moon thing and a poor excuse for a woman doing nothing IN CGI! This anime will change your life, mainly because it with make your eyes bleed so hard that they might just fall out of their sockets. On with the review!Episode 1 is pretty slow. Nothing happens.Episodes 2-5 things begin to pick up, with nothing happening even faster.Episode 6 is pretty special, with nothing happening.Episodes 7-10 is where it gets fun, with special attention paid to the parts where nothing happened.Episodes 11-12, the final episodes- It got really emotional when nothing happened. I might’ve cried a little.I’m expected to analyze the different components of this anime, but I find that I first must go over a crucial tidbit of information before we get to the real meat and potatoes, if the potatoes were grown in shit and the cows were reenacting a scene from “the Human Centipede.”Before someone points out that it’s a kids show and that it’s meant to be simplistic, HAVE YOU SEEN THIS SHOW. It’s so violent at times (the moon at one point rips out his eyes and accidentally steps on them, something you too can experience after watching this), the moon looks creepy as fuck (enough to give a 10 year old nightmares), some scenes are trippy as hell and the girl has large boobs. And yet the pastel color scheme, the way they talk, and the simplicity lead one to believe it’s meant for children. And now, the moment you’ve been waiting for! The part where I shut up and REALLY review this thing.First, the story.Actually, no. There’s no story. There’s really no story. I wish I was lying.Onto the art, you can probably guess how I feel about it. My experience with CGI and anime up to seeing Funny Pets was not pleasant. After seeing Funny Pets, my experience with CGI and anime was a horrific bloodbath of shattered dreams. The animation is something I could do better in my sleep. I am actually convinced that they walked into a preschool and had them work for fifty cents an hour (in American dollars so they couldn’t even USE the money) scribbling and drooling on the computer, and then walked out with what they called “Funny Pets”.As for the character designs, I must say WHAT character designs. There’s a sun and a moon and a chick. Their designs barely exist.This is where I’m supposed to review the voice acting, the opening, the ending, anything under the giant umbrella of “sound”. Haha, nope. If you can actually concentrate on the sound while gouging out your eyes, it may come as a surprise to you that they’re not speaking Japanese. They’re not speaking English either. In fact, the ENTIRE anime is spent with the three basically babbling incoherently in no language. You can turn the sound off and nothing will happen. The opening and ending is the kind of music that I’d expect to be played in the background of Rugrats or something. I don’t actually remember the opening or ending to well, considering that after hearing the dialog, my ears self-destructed with the intent of saving my mind.Here comes the good part, the characters. The characters are the driving force of any story, but unfortunately I cannot review them because they, once again, barely exist. They don’t have any emotion, they only have this mind-numbingly frustrating blankness to them. However, the creepy moon sometimes has glimpses of a personality, but then, oh no, he’s just a blank slate.I fully recommend this anime, if you like the self-infliction of pain. If you’re not a sadomasochist, then don’t stand within 500 feet of this anime.;Not Recommended

1;Zhen Dao Ge;shiroiyume;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shiroiyume;9;I accidentally found this gem donghua and binged it in one sitting. The style of animation is 2.5D (3D cel shaded). The art style take some getting used to due to the coarse drawing style, but if you've seen the likes of The Kingdom S1, Kengan Asura and can adapt to it, you should give this a try. The action scene in this show blew me away.The story and plot is 'seemingly' simple and straightforward, every episode the MC fights through each opponent as he trace to the mastermind for his final revenge. At the beginning of each episode is a little bit of the past reveal.The soundtrack, bgm, OP and ED are all very well done and matches the 'Jianghu' theme well.The reason I call this a gem is because the action is one of the best I've seen in donghua (and anime) in this decade. If you enjoy watching martial arts fight, the choreography, sound effects, and directing will astound you. You can almost feel the blast and impact in every punch and kick, in every clash of weapons. The fight is very fast pace yet every move can be seen clearly. You would think the fight gets boring but each opponent the MC face is different, you have sword fights, spear fights, fist fights, bamboo fights. each one is breathtaking.Produced by a small animation studio, you can feel the passion and dedication they pour into this project.I highly recommend this. A kind soul translated it properly in English, so you don't have to worry about nonsensical MTL subtitles. Just google for it.;Recommended

HHe Fangzhi, the son of a government official tries to seek revenge for the massacre of his entire family 13 years ago. His journey begins at his former servant's bar in the Gobi desert where he kills everyone involved.Story: 6/10The story has a lot of promise, it sets the story by showing glimpse of He Fangzhi's past and memories from his past instead of dishing it out in the beginning. We see the beginning of his journey at the bar in the Gobi desert. The story is fairly interesting but the fight scenes are a bit boring because He Fangzhi struggles for 5min and then at the end of the fight he kills his enemies and moves on to the next.Art & Sound: 7/10The art style and animation during fights is very close to Kengan Ashura. It's not the prettiest or detailed but it does hold well in fast paced action as does the art style in kengan Ashura. However, it does make viewers shy away from this series.The only memorable sound related aspect in this series was the ending song which was played throughout the sad moments of the series. It is soft yet resilient with the tone of this story.Character: 7/10Character design wasn't too bad. The characters fighting against He Fangzhi were mysterious to deepen the significance of his revenge all to build up and come crashing down as he comes to reality with his past. The characters that He Fangzhi leaves behind on his path of revenge also give a sense of growth as we also question the possibility of history repeating itself and a never ending spiral of revenge to ensue in season 2.Overall: 7/10It's a pretty decent watch. The characters left a bit to be desired in terms of background and depth of personality instead of killing them and they reveal hints.";Recommended
3;Zhen Dao Ge;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;7;Pillow (Vigilant?) Knife Song feels like a visual exhibition for the animation of the future. The characters are 3D rendered with 2D shading (similar to the Berserk OVAs), laid over 3D and sometimes watercolor textured backgrounds. This allows the show to appear somewhat hand-drawn and still retain all the advantages of using 3D wire frame -- namely, there could be long, high frame-rate action scenes without any blur. Reproducing all these movements by hand would be a high budget exercise, and shows in the past have sometimes used effects like flashing lights, lines and blurs to hide them. But here they are clear as day, excellently choreographed like every episode was a Hong Kong cinema action movie.In fact, every episode has one of these fights with a different villain of the week, as the protagonist uncovers the conspirators in his plot for revenge. The plot feels like Jet Li's 2002 movie Hero, or perhaps Ninja Scroll. But depending on your appreciation for choreographed fights, you might find Vigilant Knife Song to be exciting or boring. I personally found it sometimes hard to keep my eyes open, since extended fights that are barely justified by plot just isn't that interesting to me. And that's the weakness here, that besides knowing that the protagonist is seeking revenge for his whole family being massacred 13 years ago, we know very little until the latter episodes. So the first two-thirds of the show just seems like fight after fight, where the protagonist has a berserker mode trump card that allows him to win every fight.Fortunately, the interest is buoyed by little bits of Chinese philosophy exposition, all the typical Taoism stuff about the meaning of life (or the meaninglessness of revenge) dressed up in fancy language, along with gradual flashbacks and hints in the dialogue that slowly build up the reveal, and give the show more depth. What also helps is that we find that none of the characters espouse petty evil, and that they all have reasonable motivations. The protagonist is blinded by revenge, yet still generally aware of the greater good. Short scenes of the villains ordering an underling to find a partner in crime's adopted child to take care of him, or recognizing that they'd done something evil for in their view a greater good, grant a moment's pause in food for thought. These things build to a pretty significant plot twist at the end of the season, but not entirely unexpected.The plot ramps up a bit at the end, but still seems a bit shallow and trapped in the confines of the noticeable fight per episode structure. Perhaps they should have switched it up a bit, or spent more time focusing on the psychological conflicts within the protagonist to give the fights more build up. However, we're given indication that there might be more to the plot in the following season.Season One really ends at episode 10. The final two episodes are flashbacks developing how some of the characters had come to be. They are welcome, but not very necessary for the main plot. I guess it makes sense to give these characters a second impression in light of the plot twist.;Recommended
0;Wan Jie Qi Yuan;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;5;"Lin Feng is presumably a demon, or half a demon, who was hunted as a child, before he was saved by a wise man from some kind of mercenary village run by an ex-general. What happens during that time is unclear, but his powers are sealed and he is known as useless throughout the tribe, except by a lone friend, the most talented youth who promises to teach him so they could succeed together.A touching relationship buds between them, but that turns out not to be the main plot. Once Lin Feng rediscovers his powers, the rest of it becomes the standard power fantasy trope, with the consistently under-estimated protagonist questioning his identity on the brink of a human-demon war.Every such fantasy has a gimmick, and in the Incomparable Demon King, Lin Feng has this plant-based demon baby tumor that pops out of his head. It's capable of absorbing energy from around him, as well as giving him greatly enhanced environmental awareness. This ""thing"" refers to itself as a baby and calls Lin Feng dada. It's extremely annoying in my opinion. But thankfully, besides the initial development, it doesn't pervade in the show.While it's refreshing that Lin Feng isn't the typical arrogant dick that find their way into being Chinese donghua protagonists, he isn't that deep. Neither are any other character. And the story... quite mediocre so far. Nothing that really makes me look forward to anything or root for anyone. Out of the other shows running right now, it's probably more consistent than Star Martial Technique and I Am The Only God, but not as interesting as Peerless Martial Spirit, Martial Master, God of All Realms, Spirit Sword Sovereign, or Ten Thousand Worlds.In other words, if you love the genre, give it a watch, but don't expect anything groundbreaking.";Mixed Feelings

0;Tabi;abystoma2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abystoma2;7;Don’t come here expecting a coherent storyline. Rather than traditional anime, this is a piece of experimental art. The characters journey (as the name suggests) through paintings. That’s the basic grasp of this short movie. If this sounds appealing to you, continue. If not, this might not be for you.Tabi is another victim of regular anime watchers stumbling into an art piece, being confused and rating it low. Sure, it hardly looks like a regular anime – but it isn’t meant to. Tabi is a movie that feels like walking through a gallery. It offers beautiful paintings to a viewer with intriguing surreal imagery and encomporates them into an animation. That is what it sets to do and that is what it does. While you could probably find some deeper meaning to write an essay about in in, for my personal enjoyment I’m already satisfied with the gorgeous arstyle – with Tabi being an eyecandy type of animation.So yes, this is an unusual piece in the anime database, but by viewing it on its own, without trying to fit it with what your understanding of what “anime is”, I’m sure you could find enjoyment in its viewing.;Recommended

There was a couple English words here and there but not in subtitles more in scenery.a true art filmStoryThe artist took on multiple topics and expressed them mostly in symbolically fashion. An okay idea but without subtitles or some other form of guidance the viewer becomes lost in this symbolic jungle. Which is why some call the story a mess.ArtWhile animation was limited to certain aspects in frame the art show was never the same. For a viewer to relax and appreciate something visual they have to have an idea of what is to come. If it is a black and white piece they would expect a black and white piece throughout the show. This did not happen. Not only did the color keep changing but the scenery did as well. Which can be expected in an art movie. For it is almost like taking a film recorder in a museum.You are bound to see tons of different artist styles. But to collaborate all those styles into one is like taking different pieces from different puzzles and smashing them to fit. It won't work. Not only that but certain aspects were clearly copied and pasted.Sound:-no vocals- while i did appreciate the background music to some regard it did not help understand the show so in a matter of thinking it was pointless. The only plus in having it was it aided me in watching the film in its entirety as opposed to stopping it midway through.CharacterWith a plot that was a mess it makes sense that the character(s) or in this character would follow suit.OverallThis film had potential to convey a message of some matter but to not have proper direction made the entire film a pointless event. Also, what on earth was with the multiple forms of torture like alien eating babies or burning alive or stone man? So many questions i have with very little in forms of answers. My only theory behind this madness was this film was meant as a psych film. Meaning when the woman got on the train in real life and noticed that plane ad she interpreted it as a mental escape. For with life we are faced with multiple faces of trouble. Whether it is nasty traffic day in and day out, a cheating ex, or dealing with bratty kids. It can be enough pain to bring a person to a speedy end. Which is why the idea of getting away to places like Hawaii seem so appealing. But until one can bank enough time and money for a trip one must rely on religion (tranquility) as they continue to face the on going struggles that lie in front of them.;Not Recommended
0;Saru Getchu: On Air;KenpachiNoPein;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KenpachiNoPein;7;"I make it a point not to spoil anything in my review so it will be concise. I will also always preface my reviews with a quote from the show that spoils nothing.""U kiki uki u ki ki ki"" - Saru #1!Saru Getchu: On Air is a TV series based on the Playstation franchise we know as Ape Escape in America. While being based on this series however this show takes many creative liberties with its story. It is not required nor do I feel the need to recommend playing the game series first but it is a good series nonetheless.Story: 7This is a kid's show and it is made readily apparent in the first few episodes but it is good enough that an adult can somewhat enjoy quite a few elements of this story. The plot is small as expected from a show of its size. The plot does however maintain a feeling of one big arc rather than being episodic in nature, which I personally like a lot. It is fairly fast paced and never goes into giant monologues, which is positive due to the fact that they can slow the pace.Art: 7I really do not care at all whether the art is good or not but I do have one thing to comment on. This show is completely CG which usually is not too pleasant on the eyes but surprisingly looks very calming and quite nice to look at.Sound: 6This show basically has one song that is played in three different ways. It is the opening as well as the song that the monkeys sing in their dialog. It is also put as background music for the show. And while it is a pretty catchy song, it can get kind of annoying by the end of the show.Character: 6This is the classic example of why kid's shows in general don't do as well on my rating list, as well as movies and short shows. The character development is very lax. The show seems to think you can develop a character by making them fulfill their quota of one speech a day of their stereotypical one-liner. It makes it hard to like any of the characters at all.Enjoyment: 8I had a wonderful time watching this. It has an interesting enough story, adds in some plot twists and then has some decent ideas for obstacles to overcome. Despite being nowhere near perfect, I watched this in one day and felt extremely satisfied. It is short enough as to not waste my time with its nonexistent character development and childish humor yet having a pretty compelling story. I am waiting anxiously for the opportunity to watch the second series.";Recommended
0;Kotatsu Neko;Zovistograt;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zovistograt;8;These two very short stop-motion animation pieces are extremely enjoyable, especially if you do not have much time to watch them, since they are both under a minute long (not including the credits). The story, if you can pull any story at all, is quite simple: Kotatsu Neko is a lazy cat who likes TV and also goes totally EXTREME if he gets frustrated.The art itself, being a stop-motion animation, is mostly how it's animated, and it is very well done. It's mostly fluid, with great camera angles and overall good craftsmanship on the objects in the room and of course Kotatsu Neko himself. The sound decently compliments the top-notch stop-motion animation with somewhat cheesy but good EXTREME material. Plus, you can't expect much in the sound department from 45-second films.Bottom line: it's worth looking up on Youtube and watching. Really, you don't have much to lose.

It's not subbed though so you'll have to watch it raw. It's almost 10 minutes long unlike the regular Somera-chan episodes which are only 4 minute long. But the episode length is just a scam.The actual episode is in the first 3 minutes only. It's about Matsushima being Matsushima and doing batshit crazy shit mostly. Then there's a 4 and a half minutes long ending song which is followed by a drawing song (that we all love). At the end there is a short Mennouse trivia segment which tells us that they explode when they eat apples.There's very few people who watch or even know about the Somera-chan anime and this special probably won't ever get subbed, so even fewer people will watch this I guess. If you've watched the main series then you probably know that the final episode ends on a cliffhanger, so I'd say just watch this too for closure even if you don't understand japanese.;Not Recommended
0;Injoku no Heya;ThatRandomDude;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ThatRandomDude;10;"Injoku no Heya is just your average old school low budget hentai animation.It looks more like a Rated R drama than an actual hentai animation in my opinion.And even if its old school the animation wasn't that bad.Even if it ended up with a bit of NTR, funny i guess this film is one of those first series that had NTR before netorare became a thing; even if it ended slightly with NTR... it was tolerable because:1) Maid heroine's first time wasn't stolen but she actually managed to give it to the one she loved.2) Main Hero brother (good one) actually DID SOMETHING to save maid heroine and brought justice to what they did to her.The story goes as follows: (the following contains spoilers so read at your own risk)Nanase is a maid in a rich household and she fell in love with the older brother of 3 siblings who is going to die of a terminal illness.Because she was getting too much attention, this brought the jealousy stares and discrimination of the other maids who perhaps also had a thing for good brother, specially the discrimination coming from the mistress of the house who was the youngest sister with an obsessive brother complex.The sister was a total bitch queen wannabe and even punished Nanase (maid heroine) with BDSM play as dominatrix for being close to her beloved Onii-sama.Things went down south and shit hit the fan when Nanase managed to bring hope to Kazuki (good brother) for living and gave her first time to him to show him how is better to live, confessing her love for him and bee accepted.The sister saw them involved in intercourse and broke apart.Then she released the bad brother, who was a serial rapist and psychopath in order to get revenge at maid heroine by making bad brother rape her.Bad brother then raped all the maids on the house and even kills one of them... which is really saddening.And then sister trapped good brother and tried to inverse rape him.Good brother tried to stop her but she told him that bad brother told her as kids that they were not blood related so her love is valid, which was a lie and bad brother confessed to it making sister grow in shock of being lied to.Then bad brother start to bang maid heroine in front of good brother as sister holds him down... but doesn't get to finish as sister, in order to get back at bad brother, attacks him.And then ends up getting raped by bad brother herself.In here I make a pause for observation... I find a bit of an error and contradiction here.When bad brother penetrates sister, blood comes out and he says that he took sister's virginity.How ever, several minutes earlier, when sister tried to inverse rape good brother, she inserted his penis all the way inside and was deep within.Either the good brother has a super micro penis (Which he doesn't because they show his penis and he is of average size) or the animators forgot this and continued on.Which I find as an error.Continuing on, after being raped by bad brother, we have a bit of bukake; good brother stands and fight bad brother off wounding him.Then out of nowhere an earthquake shakes the house and it began to break apart, I call this bullshit but they use for a dramatic climax.Anyways, good brother throws sister and maid heroine out of the room and tells her to take care of his sister.And then sacrifice himself to save them both by closing the door on the collapsing room.Before his death, he thanks nanase for giving him a reason to live, but was wasted when he sacrificed himself to save them.Well, he is going to die anyways, right? So might as well die a Hero.Never the less, the story was not obnoxious and was quite enjoyable.

0;Injoku no Heya;Mister_Roshi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mister_Roshi;3;"Lewd Room is a fairly old hentai that follows a wealthy family and their maids. The main character is a sickly young man who is in love with one of the maids, who is also in love with him. However, his sister is in love with him as well and becomes extremely jealous of the maid and the attention and eventual affection he gives her. This causes her to abuse the maid and eventually releasing her crazy brother on the household that leads to all kinds of mayhem. While for its release it might have been dark, edgy, and somewhat fresh; it doesn't hold up very well to modern standards. The story is very rushed with large plot holes scattered about.The art and animation might be the worst thing about this hentai though. The characters are poorly drawn and at times have lopsided proportions or blob like features, To go with that is some stiff animation that really highlights its low budget. The audio as well is poor quality, but some of that can easily be blamed simply on when it was made.Overall its not that entertaining, but it also isn't the worst hentai I've seen. If it had modern art and slightly better animation it would have gotten a more mediocre score of around 5. As for who might enjoy it, I would only suggest it to those that either like older style hentai or if your curious to see what hentai looked like from a couple decades ago.";Not Recommended
0;Kinnikuman II Sei: Second Generations;WhatAGoodShow;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WhatAGoodShow;7;Kinnikuman II Sei: Second Generation is a movie based on the sequel to Kinnikuman, the grandfather of many old fighting shonen people like to this day like Dragon Ball, Naruto and even One Piece.However, this movie doesn't require any knowledge about the source material or its predecessor to be enjoyed as it is a simple action flick.The Kinnikuman fights, or Ultimate Muscle for people outside of Japan, usually take place on rings and it is a wresting based fighting shonen. The characters fighting are referred to as Chojin which possess superhuman strength and abilities based on their designs. They come with unique strength and weaknesses as well as since fights take place in different kinds of rings, the environment usually plays a role as well.In this movie, not much of these will be seen sadly.The story involves with the main cast, the Justice Chojin who fight to protect Planet Earth, interacting with their fans. An Evil Chojin appears called The Cyborg and beats up most the cast and kidnaps the coach of the main character Mantaro Kinniku, also known as Kid Muscle.Mantaro has to defeat The Cyborg and rescue Meat.A simple plot with a decent message put inside. We get a little of the mindset of various characters. The main character of the shows is obviously a selfish coward who tries to avoid getting involved at all cost, but a part of him when the situation calls for it he builds up courage and fights for those he cares about.It is known for not taking it serious and being insanely goofy.For Kinnikuman fans this movie might be missing some of what made the fights in the main story fun like unique strategies that seem simple but one won't come up with normally. The fights while looking impressive and great by fighting shonen standards feel basic compared to Kinnikuman fights.For non-Kinnikuman fans that want to give it a shot: If you aren't bothered by the character designs and toilet humor like the MC pissing his pants from time to time, you might enjoy it. It is a side story of a continuation of a very good anime that set the standards for what many fighting shonen are known for.;Recommended

As I have seen it, I will write something, but calling it a review would be an overstatement. Plain and simple, this is a film with hardly any substance, no artistic message to speak of, a simple collection of clichés tied together in a tedious way. The animation is bland, automatised, simple linework and fields of flat colour between. If I felt particularly intellectual, I could probably find a connection between Japan's corporate feudalism and the soulless blandness of this film, but a few hours after finishing the film I hardly remember it, it is just that bland. So put this on a line of TVs being sold at a Christmas sale at some supermarket, as it is merely a symptom of the consumerism that defines most of what Christmas is to the wider public - I see no other use for it.

Stylewise, it was nice to see something off main stream.I did enjoy the music for the instrumental parts, but I must say the few songs this anime had were awful. The lyrics were really cheesy and beyond cliché, and they made me wish they would have ended soon. I don't understand why they had inserted those songs there in the first place. Maybe they were after something Disney-like?I liked the story for its battles and mythology connections, though I would have wished for more development and screen time for the supporting characters. Some of the more ""artistic"" parts of the film were maybe a bit too long, which made them boring, but they didn't bother me that much because battle would soon take over.Overall the story could have used some more depth.

0;Sei Michaela Gakuen Hyouryuuki II;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;4;First, let me just say that I'm a fan of the first OVA, St. Michaela Gakuen Hyouryuuki. While I'll admit that it wasn't perfect, I still thought it told an interesting story and did so fairly well. This sequel tends to fail in many of the aspects where the first succeeded, and ends up being not as impressive. Even on it's own, it ends up being a pretty poorly made production. Let me explain why.Story: 3/10First, the story it tells is not very interesting. It expands on the plot of the first OVA, but it does so in the most convoluted way. With sci-fi shenanigans that are not only difficult to follow, but also completely not compelling. There's also plot twists that end up feeling forced instead of natural occurrences within the tale. Things are also presented in a slapdash manner, without much context going from scene to scene, and it just feels very poorly put together.Characters: 4/10The characterization also seems to be styled differently in this film. The first OVA had somewhat realistic personalities for all of the characters, but this takes those personalities and turns them up a notch, making the characters feel a bit over-exaggerated than they used to be. This creates kind of a mental disconnect from the somewhat realistic nature of the first OVA, and the now slightly more cheesy nature of this one.Art: 4/10 (Art Style: 5/10, Animation: 3/10)The art also takes a slight dip in quality, and while it's not horrible to look at, it doesn't feel as well produced as the first one. Even though I feel like the first one was of a middling quality, it had a few glimmers of really nice animation in there. However, this sequel tends to get rid of those few glimmers and simply stays in the area of middling production values.Sound: 5/10 (Soundtrack: 4/10, Sound FX: 5/10, Voice: 6/10)The soundtrack is forgettable and doesn't add much to the overall production.The sound effects also feel somewhat dated, and don't have any kind of specific appeal to them.The Japanese voice actors did an alright job, but some of the lines ended up feeling pretty cheesy sounding. They weren't horrible, and they all brought their characters to life, but many of the actors just felt kind of middling.Enjoyment: 5/10Overall, this is not a great sequel, and it's not a very great production on it's own. It's not something I would recommend to somebody, but it also isn't incredibly bad. I have certainly seen worse productions, but I also wouldn't tell somebody to waste their time with this.;Not Recommended
0;Maze☆Bakunetsu Jikuu: Hot Springs;seQuency;https://myanimelist.net/profile/seQuency;5;"""Fantastic!"" - Maze (Male)This is, what i would like to say about this special episode, which was included in a box-set release of the anime Maze and is supposed to be a side story, also called Episode 26, in where the characters are shown in fashions, in what they couldn't be shown in the anime itself, because it ran on air and it wouldn't have been child friendly content. Sadly, it isn't that fantastic after all, but definitely not the worst of them all.Let's start with what i found most interesting in this episode, the introduction of it. The characters were basically talking about this being a special episode, since they were wondering how there is another episode, if the main story only has 25 episodes. And then they were kind of explaining, what this episode will contain. That said, afterwards they basically just found a random hot spring out of nowhere, where it said, that this hot spring may be cursed. They still end up in it and the ""stuff"" happens.Overall a pretty funny fanservice episode, which obviously doesn't bring any new story to the anime. It's basically fanservice. The episode is really funny though, i have to admit that. Important to note, that i didn't watch the main story, the anime Maze itself. I wasn't familiar with the comedy of this show, so it caught me by surprise and i enjoyed it definitely.Nothing spectacular though, so only 5/10. I recommend this for fans of the series, people who like old-ish fanservice (90's and 00's) and people who want a quick laugh and don't want to watch a whole series.";Mixed Feelings

But unlike other historical anime, it failed greatly and disappointed me.From the beginning of the story Christopher's character showed to be rebellious and ambitious. In particular stubborn. He showed to be obsessive to the fact that he forgot his first wife Philippa and son Deago for his passion. Even after knowing his wife's condition he leaves her to meet king for his permission and while he is there she dies. Within a year or so he loves another woman and says all the beautiful words which he never speaks with his first wife. He neglected his first son a lot. I think it is wrong with the script. Reality would be different. It takes 22 episodes to start his voyage to the west and that too not showed well. The story seemed to forcefully make viewers to think Christopheras a nobleman. But as per pure observations of the words spoken by him with the people he met from Bishops to the Queen were arrogant. So ascribe the fault to the script.Art is goodSound is good.But poor story telling. Script is not good and misleading of original Christopher Columbus.

And that's a good thing!I honestly didn't know what to expect from this anime. When I saw the cover, I thought it was just another superhero anime from Tatsunoko Production, but... IT'S A NONSENSE COMEDY!The story is basically: An idiot boy who has a talking horse (yes, the horse talks and acts almost like a human in a comedy anime), an alien little boy who comes to Earth to do an experiment with a belt that, whoever wears it, gets 100x stronger, 100x faster, sees 100x more (to the point of seeing between walls and even clothes) and a beautiful girl who the protagonist falls in love with as soon as he sees her at school. And no, it is not a romantic comedy. It is just a mindless comedy anime.With this introduction, I already realized how clueless the anime was going to be. But it also has an episode here and there with a more exciting plot.The characters are all great. And Yuka... she is wonderful.The main character is quite stupid, and when he uses his belt to become a hero, he generates many funny moments. Except that he is always trying to win Yuka in the dumbest way possible.The little alien boy always gets mad at the protagonist because he doesn't do anything right with the belt.The horse... he gets jealous of the protagonist when he gets involved with some girl. I said that this anime is pretty silly.The technical parts of the anime are good. The animation is good, and whenever something needs to be fluid, there is no lack of animation.The soundtrack I don't remember. But whatever, what matters in this anime is the comedy.Of the 22 episodes, there was only one that I didn't like so much, the rest is all good.The anime, for the most part, is episodic.Well, for those who like comedy, watch this anime, it is worth it, I guarantee it. It is very exaggerated (even more so the last episode) in everything.This ""review"" is not good. And it can't even be called a review. This is more like something vague about why I liked this anime.";Recommended
0;Age Man to Fuku Chin;Angel-With-Gunz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Angel-With-Gunz;4;First I need to say a disclaimer, I was unable to find this anime with English subtitles, so I have used my limited Japanese ability and guess work (90% the latter) to piece together as much as I can about the story. If in the future I find a version with English subtitles, or when my Japanese has improved I will be sure to re-watch and make corrections to this review.SUMMARYThe plot of this comedic hentai movie revolves around a kind hearted and mild mannered salary man with an incredibly large penis, which is anthropomorphized as an incredibly horny gopher.STORYThe salary man accidentally walks in on a western adult video shoot and the actress is amazed at his size, although he tries to remain professional the cast and crew of the porn shoot are all amazed at his size and try to persuade him to star in their movies.The rest of the movie is him accidentally shocking women with his size and them instantly being captivated and determined to have sex with him, these scenes play out without much drama and include 2 western women, 1 geisha style woman and a fat yakuza boss, full marks for variety.The remainder of the movie is a lot of boardroom scenes, though I was not sure what the plot was.VISUALS and EROTICSThe animations were fairly basic but the art style has a dated charm and the lead character seemed likable enough. The sex scenes lacked variety in setting and action but at least had a wide variety of female characters, as well as one of the few examples of dog action I have ever seen in an anime.HIGHLIGHT MOMENTAlmost every time the women were amazed by the man's huge penis.CONCLUSIONOverall I would not recommend this anime unless you have a thing for fat Yakuza lady sex.OVERALL45/100;Not Recommended

0;My Little Goat;Alaudidae;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alaudidae;8;A 10 minutes long movie made with stopmotion technique, where almost every scene has a deeper meaning to itself. Although the story is rather simple, it may leave the viewer reflecting for a while after watching it. The creepiness is present as expected from a psychological horror and the appearance of the characters combined with the stopmotion techinique help to reinforce this feeling of uneasiness.The characters' development is ok, considering there isn't much time to give each of them the proper attention, they're still able to pass the message the author intended.For me the catch of this movie was the atention to detail, the subtlety in the enviroment, the reaction of the characters to the situations they've been exposed is too similar to real life.A movie worth watching.;Recommended
0;Zhu Tian Ji;AadityaTaparia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AadityaTaparia;6;Animation looked good and Plot started with interesting premise, but not much progress is made after 26 episodes with just one sect competition event. Story progress was very basic with unresolved small tensions and no world building beyond the sect. Characters look promising but again not much character development either except a few developing friendships without much emotions and bonding so far. Cultivation levels and powers/sword skills are not clearly explained and MC's upper hand over others with higher cultivation is not much explained either. MC doesn't use much knowledge from his past lives either or maybe he does but it's not explained.Whole season is lacking in fight scenes even when they happen they are very dissappointing, Sword techniques all look the same, just have different random names to sound cool.

0;Chou no Sainan;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;5;Rate a 5English SubtitledNote:there is spoken audio which is somewhat rare given the age of production.StoryBoth introduction and conclusion were either rushed in or cut short. Going back to the days of bed time i prefer to be ease in to what is happening rather than being told. Maybe it is because i overthink things. For being eased in allows the listen or viewer to relax. You don't wish much else for the viewer to feel depending on the genre it is based on. For example if you watched a horror movie and the first think you see and hear is a ghost saying boo will that scare you? Or will you start asking why? Why a ghost? I just got here and you want me gone? Slightly unrealistic on the last part but the point is on point. Slow and steady wins the race. Similar notes could be stated on a short ending but you get the idea, i hope.As for the message. This story reflects on need. Can't say what life was in the early 1900's or before but here in the 2000 era we as humans feel entitled to about everything. Whether it is a job or a parking spot. Yes, a parking spot. A small publicly owned piece of dirty flat land. Need is show by actions that lead to our goal we have in mind. At first we know our day will be busy so we try a low energy approach, begging. Generally, that tends to fail so as we fall deeper into a barrel of our emotions we go for costly energy approaches to suit our need want. Like complaining or fighting. Having given you a taste on my line of thinking let's reflect on how need works into the story.Need here failed. While it did work in some regard the story failed to teach the viewer. Rather than showing how a try and try again approach for the goal they should have gone for a match up comparison. What i mean is going back to the need approach in relation to energy input if we really thought on our first action we took at problems we would not need to waste that extra time. This is why they drill in efficiency at work. With match up comparison you take in all the factors or most of them. What is at stake? How it came to be? what is the worth? You know really become strategical about this. Then when enough information is pooled go with the verdict even if means just walking away.Art-black and white-characters and background are drawn wellSound-Although the characters voices were off track slight or clearly at times the voice work was a nice touch and did bring some connection to the story. For the acting job was decent.-A nice touch of animation sound effectsEnjoymentI know what you might be thinking older is not 'hip' or 'meh' for there are plenty of more cooler things now. While that is true, you are also wrong. Think of it this way, you understand how you were born hopefully... think in the same regard to cellphones and radios and so forth. Something had to start the change of success. Seeing a similar message or an even greater one when it was harder to show given the time means so much more. That is partially why people say our parents old stuff is worth money generally.;Mixed Feelings

Please read wisely.___________________I had a mixed feeling watching this short movie. The title was nothing relevant on its main story. Its just a simple setting to set them up into a real story. The story itself was about a kindness, regardless of ethnic differences they had, a mental state they felt, and a bad situations of their surrounding that might stressed them out. However, when its talk about the humanity, a respectable path could explained how kind people in responding the situation that happened to them. Yeah, that children and the american soldiers on his story, were a good simplicity to described that meaning.Idk about my decision, either this is an example of a good or a bad movie. But, one thing for sure, this is just a simple movie about the man and its daughter that wanted to watched a full moon but ended up hearing a nice story afterwards. The story itself, for me, was not so great. But its had a good moments on it. Its simple, by showing a real deal after the postwar period. Eventhough, they were in a war state, the humanity was not lost at all from their pure soul. Yeah, like i said much in the first paragraph, and strengthening it by a few words on this paragraph.For the sake of story's simplicity, and a relaxing ending to enjoy, i decided that this show was a fine for me. The deep meaning on its main story, made me adding more scores ti simply give my respect. If only there was some relatable meaning behind the two different factors, the moon, and that old man story, i may surely give the show a complete 9. However, so far for me, since i don't find any relations between the two different theme, rather being a complete setting, i am just pointing out this one at my 7/10 list. Thats it.For details, the storyline had its 7 scores for the sake of a good meanings behind those stories. Art, and animation details were a classic exposures. 6 at most of the time, because its just fine for me. Soundtrack kinda catchy and suit well with the theme, made me pointing out a 7 as my pure satisfaction point toward this show. Characters was 6. Nothing more to explained, because the main story had nothing related with their main characters. Enjoyment goes to 8. Because its simply i am enjoyed this, to relax my wound hearts about the world war II. Eventhough, there were fight each others, when they talked about humanity, nothing could burden their kindness. No war could stop a kindness on a kind people. A solid messages to solidified my 8 levels of enjoyment.Overall, like i said above, its just a 7/10 for me. Thats it.;Recommended

0;Ibarahime Mata wa Nemurihime;Skadi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skadi;9;"Ibara-Hime mata wa Nemuri-Hime or Briar Rose, Sleeping Beauty is an alternate retelling of the classic fairy tale. If it’s possible to turn a fairy tale into a gritty and realistic feeling drama then this short film succeeds marvelously.The story is told through stop motion animation using dolls and puppets and is narrated by the lead character, the young princess. At first it seems almost exactly like the classic story and the narration brings us up to the current events. The unnamed princess was cursed as a baby by a strange one legged man that she will die on her 15th birthday from a spinning wheel needle. This curse is altered by gentile spirits into putting her to sleep and not killing her. The princess grows up and fatefully discovers the lone spinning wheel left in the kingdom. Instead of being pricked her fascination with the wheel leads her to discover her mother’s old diary. Thus she learns of her mother’s past, the identity of the mysterious man, and the sad betrayal that lead to him cursing her.The way things unfold is never how you expect. The princess seeks out the man who cursed her and makes amends by offering herself as a sacrifice for her mother’s misdeeds. I found it interesting how it paints a realistic picture of what kind of life this type of people is likely to have lead. It’s a bit cynical, which is not all that uncommon when it comes to Japanese storytelling and romance. When the story comes to a close, and the princess has found her prince charming I found the princess' commentary to be quite poignant and memorable.As I mentioned the entire story is told through the princess narration. None of the characters are given names. The cast is small and all our impressions and observations are through the princess. She is a very practical girl and her experiences in the story eventually make her quite a cynic. By the end she has resigned herself to her life. Is she happy? Not really but given her situation she has made the best of things she really never had any control over.This is not typical ""anime"" as most people are used to. It uses stop motion animation featuring puppets. I was quite impressed though with it and with how much emotion and feeling was brought out with something as lifeless as wooden as a puppet. It reminded me a lot of those old Rudolph and Santa Christmas stories that were made with an identical type of animation. It’s definitely different and unique but I thought it was excellently done. There is very little sound to speak of. Since there is no acting save for the princess' narration and the only music is to speak of is soft background music to fit the mood.Overall I found this to be a fascinating short film with a unique take on a classic story. I feel it’s realistic and gritty story and interesting animation style make it a must watch for anyone in the mood for something different.";Recommended

0;Dreams;SolidusSnake1995;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SolidusSnake1995;5;"Let's blast this off by stating the obvious. This is not a regular series or by any means a standalone movie or episode. It is a small project, and in every sense a pure work of art as if you make the endeavor of watching it you will immediately understand that no mean to please you in a commercial sense is there. I think that any negativity against this is the love child between the perpetually fan-pleasing industry and the fans. We have to admit that in spite of anime enjoying an immense array of themes and underlying ideas as a body, the narrative media and the elements of the script from series to series to movies remain pretty methodical and typical: You have your discreet character introductions, a cemented story, a purpose, climaxes, twists, downfalls and comebacks leading to -hopefully- either a pleasing outcome that attempts to make justice of the followed course or a cheeky, rage inducing ending with the purpose of pummeling your expectations as a sacrifice to the shrine of inescapable fate, a storytelling favorite. And that's where the problem is rooted. If as an anime fan you haven't reached the acceptance that you are but a pin among a haystack of corporate spectacle, then you won't understand how damaging it is for a medium that's supposed to be primarily artistic to be plagued and defined by the expectations of thousands of ""spoiled"" individuals that expect nothing but a concrete story and annoyingly discernible emotional and ideological outlines. I won't delve a lot into the actual anime, because as stated already, it is much more of a pure work of art, thus more open to interpretation and of course criticism.Please, note that for this review, as we deal with an abstract work, aren't low because of poor story or characterization but because of lack thereof.Story - 2: It's pretty abstract as I wrote, but not to an extreme, so that you can actually paint over it with your imagination, connecting the lines yourself. Anything can be acceptable, for me it's the obvious undertones of sexuality and and maybe some evolutionary undertones, whatever.Art - 8: Here is where I don't get most people. The art is by far not infantile, it's just messy, but nicely paced, with forms fluently distorting and melting as images repeatedly spring up from inside one another, with impressive detail here and there.Sound - 5: Despite the rating, it's just up to preference. It's good for complementing the funky art, but not much of a standalone OST.Enjoyment: - 6: Again, it's rudimentary to watch it from a perspective clear of mainstream expectations. If you are bored and just need some time filler you are not going to enjoy this. But if you are feeling up to a little brainstorming this is at least a quirky way of satisfying your thirst.Overall - 5: Maybe it didn't have much to say to me personally, but I also don't regret watching this. If I have to stress something out, that would be to not let the norm shape your view on something different. This behavior has cursed generations of artists. People that thought Monet and Van Gogh were too ""unclear"" and ""childish"" or that Klimt was aimlessly provocative, or that Hendrix was a klutz are now hailed as the dumbasses of criticism's history, so don't be those guys.";Mixed Feelings

This is just food for those pretentious overthinkers that want to feel special because they watch anime that is ""2deep4u"" and that requires ""higher intellect"" in order to be understood. When in reality that is just complete BS since there is nothing deep about this anime at all.The only way this requires ""higher intellect"" is if you are so high that you can somehow make up a BS meaning for everything that is happening in this.Which is basically impossible since there is no meaning at all.";Not Recommended

0;Tachiguishi Retsuden;Spookt;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Spookt;8;"What place does food have in your life?This is the question at the heart of Tachiguishi Retsuden, a question at once simple and yet surprisingly deep. Absurdly deep it turns out. Some of us eat just to survive: mealtime being the minimum effort required to replenish energy. Some of us eat for love of food: taking the time to savor new flavors, new dishes, new culinary adventures. Most of us probably find a balance between the two. But only an elite caste has refined Food into a true philosophy, an affirmation and definition of self, an art form: the Fast Food Grifters.They look like you and me. They enter restaurants, they order a meal, they eat, but the similarities end there. Each has a special technique for fleeing the scene without paying for a single crumb.Hamburger Tetsu orders literally hundreds of burgers from a burger joint, choking its supply and demand infrastructure until it collapses. Foxy Croquette O-Gin uses her feminine charms to distract the owner of a food stall, sometimes forcing him into a variant of Jan-Ken-Pon (Fox-Hunter-Farmer); if she loses, she has to flash the patrons as payment for the meal, if she wins… well… her grift is set up in such a way to be a win-win scenario. And Moongaze Ginji sees a mundane bowl of soba as an artistic landscape, complimenting the cheap noodles initially only to discover that they taste awful, thus shaming the owner to tears while he walks away in contempt.The Grifters are the ultimate moochers.Presented as a mockumentary, “The Amazing Lives of the Fast Food Grifters” studies these individual cases of grifting in order to understand the mindsets of those involved, whose exploits are as crazy as their names. The animation style is easily the most striking feature, consisting of photographed characters pasted atop two-dimensional paper cutouts in a relatively three-dimension world. This technique, dubbed “superlivemation”, will be familiar to fans of Oshii’s film Avalon. The majority of the scenes are thus quite static, interspersed with periodic moments of frenetic movement, and depending on one’s level of patience this may prove frustrating. However, when little is happening the scene always appears as though a slowly-moving photograph -- proving both beautiful and oddly calming.As one would expect Kenji Kawai’s music is quite apt, at times reinforcing the dramatic bits, but usually playing against them to comedic effect. The subtle, atmospheric background music -- a forte of Kawai -- is easily the best. Even so, the soundtrack isn’t entirely memorable and you probably won’t feel an inclination to hunt it down. But in overall context, it is enjoyable; there’s a pervasive sense that the music is hardly taking the subject matter seriously. Heightening of absurdity? Check. And with the always engaging Kouichi Yamadera playing the part of the narrator, the sound is as much a feast as the visuals.The deeper meat here is a social critique of Japan’s changing palette over the decades, post World War II to present, as it becomes progressively less traditional and more influenced by foreign tastes. But the attack isn’t blistering. It’s more of a playful nudge, like an amused mother chiding her fussy, suspicious child into trying a new dish. It really is delicious. You really will like it.If a definition of absurdism is “people doing meaningless things in meaningful ways”, the Grifters are absurdists extraordinaire. What they say and what they do create the most hilarious moments and yet there is something so compelling about their food-stealing methods. Any idiot can run into a market, swipe a loaf of bread, and escape without punishment. A real artist does it with style, grace, and in plain sight. Oh, they’re amazing, these Grifters, they’re the anarchists of nourishment, the terrorists of sustenance!There might not be much dialogue from them, but that minimalism gives each of their lines a greater punch. Their stories act as punctuation marks to the narrator’s own tale, side dishes that become the meal itself. Each act of grifting is both a method for obtaining food and a view into each character’s approach to life. Moongaze Ginji, who bookends the story, is looking for a full stomach as much as he is searching for something artistic. In fact, it’s arguable whether food is the main motivation for any of them or if it is merely an excuse to satisfy a deeper hunger, be that social recognition or otherwise.It isn’t an exaggeration to say that this is a nearly two hour Wall of Text. Even Oshii lovers will find this his least accessible work: even shorter bursts of action, even longer stretches of introspection. But that isn’t a damning critique. This is a documentary after all and, silly though it is, it still adheres to the typical conventions you would expect. Those without a taste for such may wish to skip this.But there are always those of us hungry for new, even bizarre, experiences and to such adventurers I say: “You will be satisfied.” It’s crazy. It’s different. It’s not even close to the kind of anime you watch regularly, but it is one you won’t forget. Afterwards, you won’t look at your restaurant bill the same way -- and certainly not without a knowing smirk.So should you ever find yourself eating alongside a Tachiguishi one day, don’t worry, they’ll pick up the tab in their own way.Itadakimasu!";Recommended
0;Tachiguishi Retsuden;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;5;"Overview:It's time for another ultra obscure review! Today I'm looking at ""Tachiguishi: The Amazing Lives of Fast Food Grifters!"" This was a 2006 movie written, produced, and directed by the legendary Mamoru Oshii. It's free to to view on Youtube with accurate subs...yet only 100 MAL users have seen it! This is considered Oshii's forgotten movie for a good reason...it's EASILY the worst thing he's ever made. We can forgive Oshii though because to err is human. Even the greatest film directors usually make at least one dud, unless they die young like Tarkovsky.Plot:Fast Food Grifters is an ostensibly comedic mockumentary about Japan's most legendary practitioners of mooching and the exquisite art of the ""dine and dash"". The film loosely covers Japanese history from 1945 to 2006 and shows the greatest restaurant moochers of each decade along with their outlandish techniques. The actual purpose of the film though is to bemoan the gradual erosion of traditional Japanese food along with Japanese culture. Oshii created the film as a Leftist critique of Americanization and American culture's perverse, strangling influence on traditional cultures around the world. Remember back in 2004 when Rammstein released their song ""Amerika""? This movie is like a shitty, overly self indulgent version of that...lasting 2 hours. Oshii has long held unfavorable views of the US, dating back to the late 60s protests and his brief time with the Japanese Communist Party. For some reason, he bottled up that anger until 2006 and then dumped this mess on us. There is a reason even Oshii's most diehard fanboys NOPE the fuck out of this film.Art:The art is another divisive element. It's this weird, grotesque hybrid of live action and stop motion animation using paper cutouts. Honestly this looks EXACTLY like something Courage the Cowardly Dog would do in the late 90s.Overall:I gave this a merciful 5 because I sincerely believe there's a decent film buried somewhere deep in this garbage pile. Sadly, the way its executed is an absolute chore to watch and essentially becomes ""Old Man Yells at Cloud"". I feel like Oshii fundamentally misunderstands American culture. US culture is not an all powerful juggernaut that influences all cultures in a one way exchange. US culture itself is extremely maliable and influenced by dozens of other cultures. Compared to Japan, America's culture and traditions are extremely shallow and weak. Japan has been eating the same food, prepared the same traditional ways for often 800-1,000 years. America became obsessed with cheeseburgers after WW2, Chinese food in the 70s, Japanese food in the 80s, Mexican food in the 90s, Indian food in the 00s, and currently Thai and Middle Eastern food. We barely have a culinary tradition. Our most ancient and sacred culinary dishes are artery clogging, Southern Soul Food, because at least that dates back 200 years.Many people on MAL want to eventually complete the Oshii filmography, but that unfortunately means eventually watching this one. I decided to take the bullet for my fellow anime elitists and watch this one so you don't have to. Instead, you can save yourself 2 hours by just watching the aforementioned Rammstein song Amerika, and then watch this 40 second clip from the film Brother 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LBi0xQH5Og&list=LLJ4q0re1h9w0TRSRhq-wW4w&index=3&t=0sNow you never have to watch this piece of shit.

0;COLORs;ZNoteTaku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ZNoteTaku;9;Sometimes, a single look and a chance encounter are all that it takes to form an intense fascination. For a girl with black hair (who I’ll call Kuro since she doesn’t actually have a name), she sees a girl with pink hair (who I’ll call Pinku, because again they have no name in-text and their pink hair is one of their defining physical features) out by the train station. For a fleeting moment before the train goes by, they make eye contact. That expression that Kuro saw matches that of the boy who just recently joined their class. A thought occurs to her as she lies on her bed and turns over – “Is this the same person?”As time passes, Kuro cannot directly get an answer to her question. But as to why? Well, it’s certainly not for the lack of opportunity. After all, if this boy and Pinku are the same person and they happen to be in Kuro’s class, then wouldn’t walking up to them and just bluntly asking be the most-sensible thing to do? The problem though is that asking about such a private matter is, needless to say, horribly unwarranted. For someone who has such an intensely personal way of being, particularly because of something relating to sex or gender, that’s not the kind of thing that Kuro, both by politeness and her own shyness, is able to just ask about, no matter how innocent the intent. But Kuro actually asking that ultimate question is, ultimately, not the point – rather, the *COLORs* MV is a rumination on an answer always being just slightly out of reach, either in terms of its literal or metaphorical meaning.And it’s because she never gets a proper answer that Kuro is dogged by the thought in numerous ways. We as audience members know the truth through numerous audiovisual clues, yet Kuro, the one who is not in the know, constantly finds her curiosity and intuition thwarted by circumstance or her own inability to muster her courage. Director Araki Tetsurou (*Bubble,* the Studio WIT seasons of *Attack on Titan,* and *Death Note,* among others) built every almost-encounter to touch on the possibility of “what if,” before beautifully backing down and letting the unfortunateness of the moment set in. Kuro passes by a café where Pinku is drinking something (which opposites a portion of the second verse), but decides to catch up with the people she’s walking with instead. She spots Pinku at a festival, but before she decides to go find and talk to them, Pinku has had plenty of time to move somewhere else, not knowing that Kuro was even there. All Kuro can do throughout the animation is observe Pinku from a distance, captivated by the glorious array of color and light from the fireworks that surround them.The image of Pinku, rather than the boy from class, is what dominates the MV. So, as the MV’s story gradually unfolds, we learn that it is Pinku’s impression on her, more than the boy, that is likewise what dominates Kuro’s imagination. We can only guess just how many nights Kuro spent wondering about them. And every time that they just miss one another in some way, and the end of the MV hits with its perhaps exaggerated but non-literal climax, there’s always the underlying thought that how would what we see transpire if they did, in fact, meet early? Would their destinies have changed, or would they just drift apart again?Yet maybe that’s a fool’s errand because Kuro’s question is far too simple. We are also privy to seeing the Pinku that Kuro is not able to see, as we spend time with Pinku talking with figures whose faces are obscured. Pinku’s double-life as an idol is itself a double of what Pinku really does, showing that, in a truly nuanced fashion pertaining to sexuality, there is always more than simply what a clean label would insinuate. The beauty of *COLORs* is how it combines its themes of doubles and surface-level questions about sexuality to show the multifaceted complexity of a person. When the ending arrives, it’s a foregone conclusion that Kuro never could have averted because her understanding of Pinku would have been dominated by only one impression of one half of who they were. For as much as Kuro fascinated (or idolized, to use a more textually-applicable term) and developed a complex about Pinku, distance would always be kept no matter how close they got. It therefore becomes less that “she could have asked” but also “she wouldn’t **truly** have found out,” nor that she should have to. Pinku, both as an individual and in the power dynamic between them and Kuro, owes the world nothing.All the while, Sawano Hiroyuki and Hata Morihito’s music plays with its beautiful swirl of electronic sounds. Even from the first time that Kuro sees Pinku, the gradual descent of the bass fades in and out, as though it itself is as uncertain as Kuro. The verses stay relatively low and are melodically constrained, with few disjunct motions and often accompanied by descending motions. It’s rather unassuming, as though mirroring the image of the boy that Kuro saw on that fateful day when he joined their class. But as we realized, there is something behind that visage, and the chorus is what happens when you pull back the curtain. Structurally, it acts in much of the same way as the verses, but in raising the overall register of the vocals, it allows the piece to adopt a more exclamatory air. The jumps are also more frequent and starker, powerful statements of presence. The voices, which double and harmonize to encapsulate Pinku’s double-life, are also allowed to trail off and slightly down-pitch at the ends of certain phrases, emulating a musical sigh as though Pinku themselves was breathing a sigh of relief that they can now don the pink hair and clothes that they wear with such poised confidence.That confidence, and the wider breadth of expression retained with all the characters, is vital to making *COLORs* work, especially since sex, gender, and performativity are so integral to the overarching metaphor. Yoneyama Mai, whose previous efforts include the visually-lush “YOKU” MV by Eve, manages to accomplish precisely that through her phenomenally-delicate character designs, as do the numerous animators who brought these creations to life. At times seemingly gliding and at others creating powerful bursts of physicality and emotiveness, Pinku is always caught in a sensuous whirlwind (sometimes the wind is more literal) that visually highlights their double-life. Particularly during the brief dance sequence, the presence of blue, white, and pink allude to the colors of the transgender flag, and coupled with the burst of exertion and the use of close-ups, mediums, and distant shots, shows that Pinku is at their most physically and emotionally liberated when in this state of dress and performance. Animated by osumin, it is a dance of celebratory self-actualization.*COLORs* is beautiful. Delicately put together, the story told within is aided by such a mouth-wateringly beautiful aesthetic and manages to come across both as heartfelt and large in scope despite the brief runtime. Always striking and always succeeding in its resonance, it has entered a realm of musical entertainment that I am always searching for – unbridled creative expressions of depth and poise where each viewing shows me something new.;Recommended
0;COLORs;H-A-M-M-Y;https://myanimelist.net/profile/H-A-M-M-Y;4;Last March, I came across a YouTube Short titled “This is NOT Actually an Anime Series” by Kito Senpai. The video introduced it as a music video animated by TOHO Animation and Wit Studio with the music composed by Hiroyuki Sawano and sung my Motohiro Hata. The YouTuber went on to praise the video for its gorgeous animation and soundtrack. Curious, I decided to look it up and found its entry on both AniDB and MyAnimeList. I then found the video on YouTube and gave it a watch to see what’s it about.COLORs is a 3 minute long music video which was released on TOHO Animation’s 10th anniversary along with 4 other shorts:-1) Tentai Kansoku (Astronomical Observation)2) Himitsu no Hana no Niwa (Nana’s Secret Garden)3) Neko to Wakai se na (Don’t Reconcile with Cats)4) Detarame na Sekai no Melodrama (The Melodrama of a Trashy World)STORY:The story is about a girl who falls in love with a guy who happens to be a cross-dresser and a part-time idol. The first half of the story is a slice-of-life which revolves around her trying to understand her feelings and trying to find ways to get closer to the guy, but starts to get increasingly disheartened as the guy drifts further away due to his double life. The second half of the story sees a tonal shift away from the first half’s slice-of-life and the guy’s role in the story is further expanded.I’m honestly conflicted about what I have watched. While the first half of the video had a fairly decent premise and reminded me of many animated music videos I have seen in the past, the second half felt like a confusing and a convoluted mess and left me with way too many questions, with absolutely none of them being addressed throughout the whole course of the video (somewhat justifiable due to the short runtime). Also, the lack of dialogue leaves most of the interactions up to interpretation.I’m hoping this video was just a preview and that we would be given either a proper anime series or a feature-length movie which would answer my questions, as well as give us some backstory about how the girl figures out the guy is a cross-dresser and that what motivated him to do so. At the very least, make the progress of the story more fleshed out and coherent! The video’s sudden genre shifts are something that do not go well in a 3-minute short.CHARACTERS:As far as the characters are concerned, I find the male lead to be pretty interesting, mainly due to the reasons why he began to cross-dress and become an idol as well as his roles later in the story. The female lead, on the other hand, felt kind of bland and lacked the quirks the guy had. Honestly, it felt like if you cut her out of the picture, the progression of the story would’ve been left unchanged.ANIMATION:The video’s strongest points are its music and its animation. The studio behind COLORs is Wit Studio, the same guys behind animating the first 3 seasons of Attack on Titan, the first season of Vinland Saga, Seraph of the End, Ousama Ranking, Vivy, Spy x Family, and many more. The animation is fluid and crisp and just really pleasing to look at and is synchronised quite well with the song.MUSIC:The music of the video (also called Colours) is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, a veteran composer in the anime industry who is well-known for working on the songs on many anime (OPs, EDs, and OSTs) such as Blue Exorcist, 86, Attack on Titan, Kingdom, Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These, and so on. The singer is Motohiro Hata who has also sung for Naruto Shippuden and Teasing Master Takagi-san. The song itself is pretty good and catchy, but not ground-breaking.VERDICT:4/10 (Below Average, But Not Bad)I’ll be blunt, the animation and music of the video are its biggest saving graces. The story, especially the second half, were difficult to wrap my head around. As I said before, the story would have been far better had this video been either a proper anime series or a feature-length film. 3 minutes is way too little time to shove so many plot points into. Superb animation and music can only take you so far with a confusing story. Rather, the effort feels wasted.Likes: The animation and the music.Dislikes: The second half of the story and the lack of explanation to what’s going on.;Mixed Feelings

This is a anime abomination.I dare anyone to find a worse piece of officially released animation.The story is incredibely basic: Hot teachers have sex with a student. It is cliché, predictable and maybe a bit tired for some, but don't worry after episode 1, the story is completely abandoned and it just shows random, horribly animated sex scenes. Well, we can't really call them sex scenes. They are more like a poorly compiled GIF collection of large shaking tits (and this comes from a guy, who loves large shaking tits).The overal quality is incredibly poor. The art and animation get even worse as the series goes on. Animation looks like it is half finished. Characters look like someone fell asleep at the drawing board. The voice acting sounds like nobody even tried and by episode 3 backgrounds are no longer present. It is akin like watching a train wreck. It is both fascinating, yet gruesome. The later episodes especially look like they were released somewhere half-way in their production.It is probably related to Yamamoto Yoshifumi's Manga ""G-cup Teacher Reiko"" also released in 2000, but there is no way to be certain of that right now. That is a great manga, it has a fun story and some great artwork.

Whether it was the translator or the actual story’s plot there is a racist remark or word depending on view.PlotIntroduction was kind of cheap and pointless. Went with the old saying, ‘all revved up and nowhere to go’. Which perfectly documents its stature to the film. Its design was to influence an ecchi appease but only really captured you in if you were either a rookie to ecchi/hentai or an auto fan. In terms of its connection to the main story was nothing. A complete sex appeal that would have been better cutout and used as a bonus feature.Aside from the ecchi start out the movie had a nice little start out feature as well as for the ending. Each one was different. As for the start out it showed the transformation between the character in the film to the person providing the voice. If that wasn't cool for you maybe you will enjoy the behind the scenes of the studio in mid production of the film?ArtI am appalled and shocked. The show has two features part of the story that is hand drawn and those fill-ins that are computer generated. I am not sure if computer generated art for this film was cheaper at the time but completely throws off the authenticity of the film. Not to neglect to mention would have worked without it.The idea of the red headed stripper may not have been the best choice, ‘period’. Aside from my joking message the same scene with its use of cartoonist comedy/appearance reminds me of a certain American cartoon movie involving a certain white rabbit. So, can’t say this wasn’t original.While I can see the use of having cartoonist use in films I vote against it. Sure, it can derive a comical response but this is also an action film that involves blood and such that isn’t portrayed in a cartoonist presentation. Therefore the line of any future actions lays unmarked on the porter of reality and fiction.Gee, I wonder which company paid more to fund this anime.

0;Blue Seagull;TheAngryNerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheAngryNerd;2;Well, that was surely an experience.Review:Story/Plot/Writing: It revolves around the protagonist trying to get back a sword from his great grandfather or something and later on he also has to save this one chick. For some reason this action film also has numerous sex scenes throughout it and in my opinion I think they were really pointless and contributed nothing of value to the narrative, they were just there. The dialogue is very boring as well.Characters: Nothing notable about them. Their only purpose was to progress whatever story this film had forward. They aren't deep enough to get the viewer to root for them, or care for them either.Art/Animation: The art looks mediocre, and the animation is really lacking. Loops are often used in many scenes throughout the film and it can be a bit jarring at times. Another weird thing to take note of are the few moments where the people switch to a western cartoony art style, like the men in the stripper scene. It makes this film inconsistent and feels unnecessary, especially considering that this is supposed to be an action film, one with sex scenes at that! But do you want to know what's truly jarring? The CGI in this film! It looks terrible, and completely threw me off-guard and ruined my immersion! Combine this with the agitating, bizarre camera movements and you get CG scenes that are very disorienting. Why did they do this? The film could have worked well without it! What were they thinking?Sound/Music: The voice acting was really bad, and the music is nothing special.Overall: I was bored out of my mind watching this film, the credits showing the behind the scenes was way more interesting than the plot! I swear I was about to fall asleep at one point. Blue Seagull is a strange piece of Korean media, one that has faded into obscurity, and deservingly so (no offense to the production team). 1.7/10 Rounded to 2/10 for MAL score.;Not Recommended

0;Shiguang Guiyu;ParagonSan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ParagonSan;2;"This anime is an embodiment of tropes thrown together, mixed and poured without apologies. It’s a great example of what not to do.Shiguang Guiyu (Prisoners of Time) is a dònghuà (Chinese animation) about a regular Hero’s Journey with a regular life that suddenly is chosen by the destiny to save a princess and the entire existence from the Armageddon, all while dodging all the onslaughts of the Big Bad with the most powerful device of all: plot armour.Sort of. That’s it. Kinda.The whole anime is kind of amateurish and the obvious tropes are so scratched in your face that you feel they trying hard. The story starts with a regular man that had visions about a girl in his sleep. He totally believe his visions, to the point of talking about it to his colleagues and treating the visions as normal, mundane things, even spouting them from time to time. (I’m surprised that, given the intensity of these visions, he didn’t ask for medical treatment. Could be overwork. Maybe he could get a medical leave and use it to carefully meditate on these visions whilst also having the time to play videogames. Win-win situation. But no, let’s continue working, talking about them dream hallucinations, flooding web searches, forums and the colleagues’ time.)All good, all ok, we can accept that. Maybe it’s just his personality. It’s only the beginning, after all.But things get worse. We have the privilege to see an alien race that can transform into humans and is searching for the Big Miraculous Device that civilizations desire. This alien race has the sort-of Big Bad (or warrior, or avenger, you know, the powerful being that is only one step lower the Overlord on the bad side) that kills people and things ruthlessly and can disguise itself by using human clothes, but, hang on, when it uses its powers, cue to unnecessary change in clothes to provocative, sensual, let’s-show-skin-just-because ones. So, this warrior/almost-overlord alien discovers that the Hero has this Miraculous Device that was given to him by an rapid encounter with the Loner Warrior from the Good Alien Race and Uses Cool Clothes and Has a Cool Alias. Of course, as every generic plotline, the Bad-side Warrior will come to the Hero to kill him.But how? Using the mighty powers of the alien race, of course!The warrior is totally overpowered and can warp the reality around it for over a thousand kilometres, yet, when the hero is about to get the blast of death, something happens. Miraculous, I say. Guess what? Well, you might say anything; it will fit, because the generic tropes will diverge to make sure the lack of originality stays. The hero is miraculously saved by the Miraculous Device? At the brink of death, the villain gives a chance to the hero to live because “I want to amuse myself before killing you”? The hero gets to see the utmost dread in the Universe, only to see nothing happening, again? All of the previous alternatives?Things don’t stop here, there’s also that loner that reveals itself to be experienced in dealing with the devil. To cut explanations, it’s a Wolverine type. Kinda. But useless.(That’ all, the paragraph is short. Really, no double-meanings.)Also, everything is an excuse to fight. The intergalactic alien race will stop disguising itself and then set terror on the scenario. Really? Couldn’t they be discrete? You know, just warp a part of their bodies instead of transforming totally. Or maybe use intelligence, tactics and strategies to defeat their enemies without giving them a chance to live. But without that it wouldn’t be possible to extend the animation unnecessarily. Since everything is about fighting, the special powers of the hero(es) will represent themselves as something that can be useful in a fight, like blades. Oh, and they only activate when the users about to die (this is literally said in the animation, I’ll give them credit for that meat-joke – if it was a joke! -- , at least it’s honest).To crown this mess, the girl in the visions of the hero is a princess from the Good Alien Race that’s about to get extinct and the Bad Alien Race is using time for sort of selfish reasons and control, but no further, meaningful backstory is given. Well, they give, but it just leaves everything at the same weight anyway, nothing changes.Well, this is enough information, although spoilery, it’s necessary for an important thing: play the game of prediction. With all these tropes mixed and smashed that way, it’s not hard to predict the end of the story and even the attempts at appearing “deep” (yeah). It’s hard to say anything positive about this work. The animation is too simple and amateur, like some American animations that imitate the tracing style of anime, the story is bleak and so predictable that it seems it was done in half an hour, the sound effects are generic ones that one can find anywhere and the voice acting is… ok, I think; I don’t understand the language enough to even judge it. Everything seems like a YouTube high-school animation project from 2008. I can forgive the sounds, animations and voice acting, because everyone starts slowly and cannot have the budget to do boom-boom-blast, original things, but this… I’m sorry to use this word… this is cringey to watch, too tryhard (redundancy?), the story makes you feel dumb, the whole dònghuà is like a challenge on who endures it the most.So, do not watch it. Skip it. You are better off watching cat videos.";Not Recommended
0;Ubasuteyama;RedPlaty;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RedPlaty;9;"Ubatseyama- The Mountain Where Old Women Are AbandonedAn old silent film about a village where old people are exiled since the Lord does not like them.Story~ 8The story is very good. The main character disobeys the Lord's command to give up old people for exile by hiding his mother. The role this mother plays is integral to the story, which I will explain a little later; this is something the Lord and his subjects all seem to lack. The main character loves his mother dearly, which is another symbol for the respect younger people should have for the elderly. The story challenged the mythical/folklore-ish Ubasute, where the elderly were left out on mountains or in forests to die.Art~ 10For an anime from 1925, it certainly does have outstanding art. In certain frames, you can even see the paint strokes individually, showing the intimate detail that went into producing this anime. Sure certain frames are reused, but that is to be expected from the early decades of animation. The art does not come in the way of figuring out the story at all. It is easily discernible that this anime had a higher budget than many other anime from this era.Sound~ 5 (0)This is a silent film so the score should be 0. However, if I rated it a 1, it would look like I am saying the sound was Pathetic, by mal's rating. The anime simply has no sound. It can't be either good nor bad.Character~ 8Every character is symbolic. They all represent something that the original story was trying to portray for it's audience. The wise mother is a symbol for the wisdom that people gain over the years; anybody could have done what she did, but the only problem was that she was the only one that escaped persecution. The son represents veneration to the wise, for he would not be here, were it not for her (including physically, which is a nice way the original story tied this in). The Lord is a symbol for the popular public; whatever they decide becomes the status quo. There are many variations of this story with other characters.Enjoyment~ 10I enjoyed this anime a lot. It is one of my favorite anime from this time period, since I did not expect such advanced story-telling and plot development from such an old anime. In just 10 minutes, I was left with an amazing story about the importance of wisdom. I even tried to solve the puzzles myself, and was astounded at their answers. There is something special about finding a really old anime like this with an actual story that flows well, and not just some random scenes put together because they have to adapt so much content in a couple minute long video. It is long enough to get it's point across, while still being really high quality for its time.Overall~ 9I probably spent more time on this review than on the actual anime, but it is worth checking out for fans of really old anime, or for people who want to try something from this age of black and white silent cartoons. Some of these anime can be harder to decipher what is going on, and many are adaptations of Japanese folklore that only someone with intimate knowledge of this aspect of their culture would understand. This particular anime is very easy to follow and understand, while also being very symbolic. Ubasuteyama is a great watch overall.";Recommended
1;Ubasuteyama;Alaroki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alaroki;9;Story: The Story for this anime was very good. I enjoyed it alot and it told an amazing moral. The only problem I have was that there was no character growth (more on that in Character).Art: Amazing. I loved it. It was very traditionalist to old Japanese art which was popular at the time.Sound: N/A no soundCharacter: The characters were pretty static honestly. The only person who learned a valueable lesson was the antagonist, but we didnt even see him much often or get any background on who he is and why he is like that.Enjoyment: For it being one of the oldest anime created, I really enjoyed it.Overall 9/10;Recommended

That is perfectly fine but if there is something that is done rather rashly because of this then it is not right. For with everything in life there is a purpose even if it is small. To be able to grasp this message means to be the story and art was done well. The introduction was done perfectly from a story telling point of view.

0;Mangchi;Apolygon2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Apolygon2;5;"since there is no other review for this 17 year old movie, I decided to write one.I originally watched this movie as a kid, and loved it. so I decided to re-watch it. although finding it was a challenge to say the least, I was going to give up, I did multiple times in fact, but the tip of my tongue subreddit somehow pulled it off.story 5/10""The story is about a boy named Mangchi. He is small, but he possesses a magical hammer that helps him get around all his problems. Mangchi lives on a small distant island called Candlestick because everywhere else has turned into a wasteland because of some big catastrophe. When Princess Poplar from the kingdom of Jemius is being pursued by henchmen of the conspirator Moonk, Hammerboy sides with her, ready to unleash all his latent powers in order to save humankind.The movie premiered at the Big Apple Anime Fest on August 30 2003, and went into wide release in South Korea on August 6, 2004.(Source: Wikipedia)""well the ""everywhere else has turned into wasteland "" part was barely hinted at, but I say the wiki got the synopsis right, so I'm going to write about everything else.the story has a problem with it's pacing, but it's not THAT bad. everything just seems slightly slower and more often faster than it should be, which is annoying, but not the end of the world.the writing, is ok. I'm going to give it credit for some of it's choices and plot points, but most often than not the story is just kind of generic.and as far as the actual order of events goes, it's pretty good. the idea had potential to make this movie a solid 7/10, but sadly the pacing, the writing and specially the directing, stopped that from happening.Art 3.5/10now the art and animation were actually solid, a little weak for a movie that came out in 2004, but still, solid. the main problem is the directing, which was the worst part of the movie. it feels like the movie was directed by someone who is not a director.the shots are just so boring. the transitions are off putting at times, and the action feels stiff and unnatural. now it's not garbage, but it's bad, and it is this movie's biggest downfall.sound 7/10I'm not going to talk rate the voice acting, since I didn't watch the movie in it's original language, but the music is really solid. if there was one thing that lived up to my expectation, it was the music.it was no masterpiece, but a very solid soundtrack nonetheless.characters 5/10most of the characters are basic. with the villain being especially 1 dimensional. they aren't bad, they aren't great, they are just MEH. although I have to say, because of Poltapo (I hope I spelled it right) I kind of want to give it a 6. he wasn't that special either, but he was just kind of charming I guess? and he was the closest thing this movie had to having proper character development.enjoyment 5/10even with my massive nostalgia boner, I still started to get bored during the second half. It is a kids movie, and not one that is also trying to appeal to the older audience, so don't go in with high expectations.overall 5/10as much as it hurts to say this, it's one of the most 5/10 movies I have seen. I really wanted this to be a second castle in the sky, but it really isn't.but hey, it's still a decent watch, specially if you know someone younger to watch this with.well that's all I had to say, thanks for reading.I hope you have a great rest of your day/nightpeace :D";Mixed Feelings

1;Satsujinkyou Jidai;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;1;Well, if you want to watch a collection of cheap looking static images of poorly drawn characters getting killed or killing themselves for 13 minutes, then this is the film for you.On top of the poorly done art, it's accompanied by a tepid, uninteresting score... and poor quality sound effects. The soundtrack isn't horrible, but it also doesn't stand out much at all, and I wouldn't necessarily call it good, either.Also, before anything happens in any of the shorts, there's a long, drawn out period of music playing over a single static image, and while these moments were obviously intended to build up to the final moment each time, it really just made the whole thing feel slowly paced and ended up just feeling very boring all around.;Not Recommended
0;Wakakusa Monogatari;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;4;A fairly straightforward version of Little Women -- made in 1980, and the quality of the artwork and animation are standard for the time it was made.However, the biggest shortcoming of this version is that it is only an hour long. And it's not exactly easy to compress one of America's greatest literary classics of the 19th century from hundreds of pages down to a short-length movie. The whole thing seems rushed, and the story cut up, with some story elements getting the short-shrift. If you are familiar with the story in other formats, you will undoubtedly find this lacking. And if you are not, you will not find enough of the story and characters developed to really become invested.There was a longer, episodic version that was made later in the eighties, so that might be a better way to go.;Not Recommended
0;Tanjou: Debut;HidamariSeashore;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HidamariSeashore;4;"First of all, WRAPPING PAPER ISN'T HAIR! Ahem....excuse me. That's just the name of a badge on Anime-Planet that you can earn by watching this particular anime, which is how I learned it existed in the first place. Despite the curiosity I felt after discovering it, though, I ended up spending YEARS trying to find it with English subs included. I eventually found it and was able to watch this pair of OVAs; however, it's evident now that all of that searching was NOT worth it.Lads, ladies, and non-binaries, I now present my review of the 1994 OVA series, ""Tanjou: Debut"".Tanjou: Debut, known in English as ""Birth: Debut"", is based on a 1993 video game of the same name where the player is a manager for three idols; however, nothing except its opening theme hints that this is what the anime's source material is about. Instead, each of its two episodes tells two completely different stories with some of the same characters. The first episode follows Aki Itou, a high school girl with a crush on an employee at a restaurant she frequents, who is told that said crush already has a girlfriend, and misunderstandings ensue from there. The second focuses more on Saori Fujimura as she and her two friends - one of them being Aki herself and the other being another girl named Kumi Tanaka - dig up a time capsule that they buried 10 years ago. They discover that inside of the time capsule, alongside each of their own boxes with their own possessions inside, there is a fourth box with a small bouquet inside of it, but they can't remember whose box it was....apparently.Look, I have no problem with each episode having a different plot from the last; there are plenty of other anime that are similarly episodic, but they manage to make sense for what came before each episode and even sometimes be enjoyable to watch. Tanjou: Debut, however, doesn't do either of these things. Some aspects of the second episode don't make sense when you think about what was going on in the first, such as how the relationship between two characters was established in each episode; this disconnect is rather jarring. It certainly doesn't help that neither episode is that enjoyable in the first place; both of the plots in this anime are boring, highly predictable, and full of characters I personally didn't give two cruds about. As I mentioned earlier, both episodes have the same main cast, but both iterations of these characters are as bland as the plots and go through little to no character development.As for the art....well, a quip about a certain aspect of the character designs in the form of a badge name is why I'm here in the first place, is it not? Not only is the artwork every bit as bad as you probably expect (with Aki's design being especially awful, in my opinion), but while not flat-out awful, the animation is very dated, even for its time; I'm sure that we all know that Studio Pierrot was capable of better even back then. Meanwhile, the music is rather forgettable, as it doesn't stand out when placed next to other tunes from the '90s; I don't even remember how the opening or ending themes go, much less what they were even called. The voice acting isn't anything to write home about, either.Overall, Tanjou: Debut is a bad way to spend an hour of your time. Looking for it isn't really worth it, either, but if you REALLY want to earn the ""achievement"" of watching the ""wrapping-paper hair anime"", be my guest. Don't blame me for not warning you if any negative feelings are born in your heart after you watch it, though.";Not Recommended
0;Takarasagashi no Natsuyasumi;Wicker_Senpai93;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wicker_Senpai93;7;"Takarasagashi no Natsuyasumi (The Summer Vacation Treasure Hunt) is an ONA by SANDWICHWORKS.Before I begin this review I'd like to preface, this is only a review for part one. This was supposed to be a two-part ONA series, however, part one was released back in 2014 and part two has been in development hell for years now. A preview screenshot was released back in 2015, and an update from the studio claims the second part is half-way complete, and supposedly due for release in 2019... Yeah... since there's only two weeks of 2019 left, I suppose that didn't go as planned.I wouldn't be mentioning this at all if the first part didn't end on a cliffhanger. This has got to be the Vagabond of hentai, with this ridiculous wait and all. If there's any way to speed up development by donating or something, I'd highly reccomend you try and do it. Cause I want part two damnit! ; )With that out of the way, let's begin!TnN doesn't have much of a story, since the emphasis is more on the presentation. The plot follows a sexually curious young boy who stumbles into a voluptuous woman at a bus stop in rural Japan. Needless to say, the two hit it off and your standard hentai shenanigans begin!There're only two characters in this story, the boy and the woman. I don't think their names were ever stated, so i'll be refering to them by the nicknames they give each other. Little Man and Ma'am. Little Man is very cute, almost like a character from a Nintendo game. Speaking of which, he makes numerous video game references! So he's certainly relatable to say the least. Ma'am is best described as a very kind character. She's always very carefree and loving towards her Little Man. Both characters are rather plain, but they're sweet and likable.The art is one of the most curious aspects of this ONA. TnN is a 3D hentai. Now, I'm aware 3D gets a bad rap in the anime community, but I think it's used to great effect in this ONA. The characters move a little strange, but they don't look to wonkey. I've seen better 3D hentai, but this doesn't look bad. Aside from the characters, the backgrounds look stunning! You really feel like you're in rural Japan during the summertime. It's hard to put into words, but it just creates such an incredible atmoshpere. The lighting also adds to the atmoshpere, by creating such a beautiful blend of colors. The animators perfectly captured the beauty of the outdoors.Another curious aspect of this ONA is the voice acting. Little Man is silent for the entire episode, so you have to read his dialog. I didn't particularly mind this, but it was a strange decision considering that Ma'am is fully voiced. The music isn't exactly memorable, but it's pleasent enough in order to add to the presentation. I also liked the addition of various retro video game sound effects, it fits well with Little Man's character.Parts of this ONA seemed very experimental. I normally don't like experimental media, since they often come off as pretentious and weird for the sake of being weird. But the hentai genre can get pretty stale after a while, and a bit of experimental spice can help liven things up from time to time. I particularly liked a sequence of still shots, with a song (or poem) being sung in the background.Overall, I really liked this ONA. It's truly beautiful in a lot of ways, and I actually shed a few tears after I finished watching it. I just find it so fascinating. But I'm also conflicted. It ends on a cliffhanger, and it's been almost six years since the first part was released. I know the second part is still in the works, and I sincerely hope it's released soon! Since I'd love to see more of this! 7.5/10Would I reccomend you watch Takarasagashi no Natsuyasumi? If you like hentai, then yes! This is a must watch, and more people need to see it!Hopefully if there's a greater interest in this series, it might encourage the studio to release part two sooner. So what are you waiting for? Get watching!";Recommended
0;Oedo wa Nemurenai!;Tsubakiaka;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tsubakiaka;4;Edo never sleeps, but your brain might during this.Going in blind to the manga I’ll be objective to the OVA only. Exceptionally average, Oedo wa Nemurenai! Offers a historical setting in 1700s yoshiwara. The famous pleasure district. Our main character is quite a young woman and Oiran and is for some reason important you’ll find out. (also pay attention to that cat!!! What happened there)Production quality is at most times quite poor, out of sync voice acting, many still/panning shots, and very low movement. This is all to be expected for something low budget. For anyone who has not read the source material the plot is quite choppy as nothing is clear since context is not given for anything. Unclear relationships, confusing cuts etc...Sound is nothing to write home about either as the music is a mix between win-dings like synth sounds and orchestra garageband samples. Gratefully the voice acting is fine.The main issue is there is no explanation as to why anything is happening and who these people even are until after it should have been established by some clue. Regardless for a half an hour it is not unbearable and most likely complimentary to the manga. In all honestly it gave me a few chortles as to how ridiculous it was.;Not Recommended
0;Prima Donna Mai;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;1;"Prima Donna Mai is a lackluster hentai, through and through. The story is very standard and it doesn't do much to set it apart. The characters are incredibly typical, and are just generally uninteresting. Also, this consisted mostly of sex, there wasn't really much of a story in it at all. Or, at least, the story wasn't a major focus.Now, that would normally be somewhat passable for a hentai, since it usually is about the sex. However, the animation in this makes all of the sex scenes super uninteresting. Most scenes consist of a few different static shots, and animation that is there is just about as limited as you might see in your typical hentai game; just a boring looping animation of a girl sucking a cock. This made everything incredibly boring to sit through, and made all of the sex scenes fall incredibly flat. Which, when you think about it, is really the worst possible thing for any hentai.";Not Recommended

0;Wan Wan Chuushingura;ScarletCelestial;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ScarletCelestial;3;Wan Wan Chuushingura is a movie that would be watched for one reason alone: it was the first animation Hayao Miyazaki worked on as an animator. So, unless you happen to be trying to watch every single work Miyazaki has been involved in, I would give this a pass.Story and Character: 2 for eachRather simplistic, the synopsis has the amount of depth the movie itself provides. None. It's a kid's film from the 60s which has a lot of plot shortfalls of worse movies today. The conflict can be described in a sentence, the villian and the hero are both boring. The evil character does evil things, the good character does good things.The climax of the film based in action sequences are paced terribly, and animated uninterestingly.Sound: 4The music is jazzy and fine to listen to, fitting to the scenes that they are used in. The cuts between music isn't handled very well though, which creates a disconnect between scenes.Animation: 3The design is uninteresting in most cases and some characters just look dreadful, especially the fox. A few do fit the comedic vibe of their character though.The animation itself is very general for the time period and the studio. This means there's quite a bit of stock footage, a few points characters were off model and there is little detail to speak of.Enjoyment: 3This is one work based off of Tezuka (albeit one of his much lesser known works) that I do not enjoy: I much prefer some of his other works, such as Jungle Taitei and Aru Machi Kado no Monogatari that were created in the same time period and are of much better quality in some ways.Overall: 3;Not Recommended

The voice work and sound design is particularly terrible in this one, egregious even. The entire thing felt like a throwaway production designed to fill some quota.Its the story of a dog trying to take revenge on a tiger for killing its mum. The tiger is notable for it seems like an inspiration of the likes of Sher Khan and Scar, or perhaps its the other way around.

0;Chuumon no Ooi Ryouriten;Rojo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rojo;7;"This short stop-motion movie is a fun and enjoyable watch. Despite being rather old, the animation has aged well - like a fine bottle of 1960 red wine from the Shiraz Vineyards.The jollity movements from the two hunters would probably be seen as ""terrible workmanship"" if this was created in this day and age. Though seeing as this is an anime from the late fifties it is understandable.As our two hunters venture deeper into the story and the orchestral music begins to tune in, it reminds me of shows I grew up with. Such as the clangers and the magic roundabout, which would also turn to an orchestra or some sort of a flute/percussion band for it's OST.Before long, our twitchy hunters are well within the restaurant and finding out how unordinary it is. The story progression is smooth yet quick - which is expected of such a short movie. Compared to other versions of this story, I would assume they have stayed true to the original story piece written by Kenji Miyazawa. I'm sure his story is translated online somewhere to read - so I should probably give it a look up.By the end of the movie, the ""real horrors"" of the restaurant make themselves knows and our hunters... well you'll have to watch to find out what happens to them. The story is left as complete as can be and you won't even notice that 20/30 minutes have gone by.I do suggest giving this fun little stop motion ago as it is well worth it as it can be considered a part of Japanese culture and history. If you have already seen the other two versions available this is another and original adaption that is a must see!";Recommended
1;Chuumon no Ooi Ryouriten;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;7;Adapted from an extremely witty Japanese short story into Claymation, The Restaurant of Many Orders is a delightfully entertaining horror short about animal rights. It is gloriously macabre in its themes and flips the idea of humans hunting for sports by portraying two British hunters being slowly swindled into preparing themselves as dinner for eagerly awaiting diners in a restaurant designed to entrap humans into thinking they themselves are being served food.This is the first Japanese attempt at Claymation of this length and while not perfect, it is clear that a lot of thought was put into the exploration of the three dimensional aspect of film making that traditional hand drawing animation did not have access to. The fact that the subjects of every frame are physical objects, allows the creates to play with lights, shadows and camera movements while also incorporating some elements of blocking into scenes that are usually not quite available in traditional animations. While the camera work is often janky - we're reaching the 60s at this point and the camera movements had very little reason to be as terrible as they were, the story alone made this an entertaining watch for me.;Recommended
0;Himitsukessha Taka no Tsume;wikipetan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/wikipetan;10;I do not remember how I stumbled upon this classic, but I do remember fucking around on YouTube and being compelled by such a beautiful art style, and the yellow subs at the bottom of the thumbnail meant I could enjoy whatever the fuck this was in full-joy.Taka no Tsume, AKA Eagle Talon is something of a hit in Japan. It has numerous advertising tie-ins, and even as recent as this post, a theatrical movie starring the Justice League with a budget of 1,000,000(or maybe it was less than that) USD funded by a Yahoo Auction charity.The plot of this is as simple as a team of super-evil masterminds want to take over the world from their apartment complex. Unfortunately, that does not go well for them as their efforts are thwarted by the middle-aged super hero, Deluxe Bomber.The cast consists of Hitler, an AGP, the nutty professor, a child prodigy, and Phillip. Everything is done by the animator, Frogman, who voices the characters, does the music, all the animating, etc. I think in total, the series had a budget of about 1 USD. That's changed as Eagle Talon became more of a hit, as the voices are slightly different and the animation has gotten...better?If you like such classics such as Aqua Teen Hunger Force, this anime is for you. It's pretty much the Japanese equivalent.;Recommended

1;Rebecca;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;9;When I first started getting deeper into the anime/manga fandom as a whole, I hadn't quite refined my tastes. It wasn't until 2010-2011 when I discovered what genres I really gravitated to. I know I definitely gravitated towards the World Masterpiece Theater and their adaptations of classic Western kids novels like Anne of Green Gables, A Little Princess, Little Women, Dog of Flanders, and so on. That inspired me to seek out the actual novels they were based on in question when I was in high school and college. There was one classic children's book that I noticed didn't get that treatment: Rebecca of SunnyBrook Farm, by Kate Douglas Wiggin. It's been years since I read the book, but I still own it, and I think it's just okay at best, but I like it well enough. The thing is, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm hasn't had very good luck when it came to being adapted for the screen. There are three movies made for it, none of which were faithful to the story in any way, with the 1938 one starring Shirley Temple being absolutely nothing like the original book at all. There was a short mini series that aired in England in 1978, but I can't find anything on that. So yeah, it hasn't had much success when it came to being adapted for film, and while I like other Western books more than Rebecca, I was saddened by the idea that this sweet book would probably never get anything resembling a faithful adaptation in any format. It didn't help that the WMT shut down in 2009 because of the fact that, as an article on ANN mentioned, Japan lost interest in children's anime based on Western stories. Since Rebecca never got that treatment, and nobody cared for it years after its publication, I thought it was doomed to be forgotten and fade into obscurity.OR WAS IT?!By some miracle, somebody had the bright idea of turning Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm into a half-hour long anime short film that premiered in March 2020, alongside two other shorts, as part of the yearly Young Animators' Training Project for 2020. And thus, Rebecca, or The Chronicles of Rebecca, was born. I honestly had no idea this even existed until the day after Christmas, and I noticed on the Wikipedia article for the book that it had somehow gotten an anime short based on it. Needless to say, I tracked it down right away, and it turned out to be easier to find than I thought. Also, this short is friggin' awesome! It's just oozing with great animation and that World Masterpiece Theater charm I love so much. Whoever decided to take a chance on this and bring The Chronicles of Rebecca to life, I friggin' love you. After seeing it, I can wholeheartedly say that this might be the most faithful adaptation of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm yet, and the short doesn't even cover the entire story!Now, you're probably wondering what this short film is even about. The short film is only half an hour long, only covering one part of the novel. Having read it, here's what the novel is generally about: Rebecca Randall is a fun-loving ten-year-old girl who lives with her large but impoverished family on a farm. When her father dies, life on the farm gets harder, and her mother can't handle raising so many children, so she sends Rebecca to live with her two aunts in the town of Riverboro, Maine. The aunts in question, Miranda and Jane Sawyer, are more interested in Rebecca's older sister Hannah, as she's good with housework, but Rebecca's mother still needs her help, so Rebecca is sent to live with them instead, so she can get an education and a better life. Rebecca gets along with Jane just fine, but Miranda is strict and uptight, put off by Rebecca's free-spirited, imaginative, but careless personality that's typical of any child her age. But Rebecca's unrelenting optimism breathes life into the people around her, making their days just a little better. A lot of this is just explained in narration at the very beginning of the short film, as being half an hour long, it can't exactly afford to adapt the entire novel. The producers seemed to realize this, as they made the very smart move of just adapting one event from the novel that occurs across three chapters.And really, it's easy to see that this short was made by people who absolutely know what they're doing, because the results are just incredible. The animation is really smooth and full of bright colors that just pop right off the screen, from the detailed backgrounds that are true to the time period the story takes place in, to the slightly simplistic character designs that strike a perfect balance between being both cartoony and realistic, similar to stuff like Les Miserables Shoujo Cosette or Konnichiwa Anne. I also love the short's usage of lighting and weather when conveying mood and atmosphere, such as how a room lights up when Rebecca is happy or comes to an epiphany, or how dark, somber the dining room is when Miranda and Jane are having dinner after Rebecca is sent to her room, conveying the tense atmosphere between them. Even the usage of English writing is pretty on point, and I didn't notice any spelling mistakes or basic grammatical errors, which even some WMT shows are pretty guilty of at times. The soundtrack is also very pleasant too, relying heavily on violins, fiddles, and woodwind instruments that give the short a homey, country feel about it, again, similar to that of WMT shows like Konnichiwa Anne and Les Miserables. I will admit though, the ending song is kind of cheesy and a little too mealymouthed for my liking.Of course, the cast of characters is where Rebecca really shines. Being a half hour long short, the creators knew they wouldn't be able to cover the entire story, so they chose to adapt just three chapters, all of them covering one significant event that occurs across those three chapters. Since the cast is kept relatively small, this leaves ample time for the producers to flesh them out and develop them within that half hour, and honestly, I think they pulled it off impeccably. Every character has their own unique sets of strengths, flaws, and weaknesses, and the short shows how they overcome them over the course of the short film, and even when the characters do things they shouldn't, whether it be because they were just careless or are blinded by bad events from the past, the short film is extremely careful not to portray either side as being completely 100% wrong or right. Both sides have valid points in the main conflict, and Rebecca acknowledges such, as the moral behind it is recognizing one's faults and amending them so you can grow as a person. Every character changes over the course of half an hour wonderfully: Rebecca learns to appreciate her situation and her own good qualities, Miranda learns to be less strict, more flexible, and to not let her own biases affect her judgment and relationship with Rebecca, and Jane learns to stand up for herself and call out her sister's callousness. It helps that the short film trusts its audience enough to not bash the message over their heads, letting the story convey the message organically, and never coming across as patronizing or condescending. Yes, it's a very simple story, and probably one that's been done before in many other places, but I've always held the philosophy that as long as you care about the product, actually put effort into it, and are passionate about it, you can make anything genuinely good. Seriously, this is what I wanted out of, say, something like Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure, which refuses to actually flesh out its characters in any meaningful way in favor of zany comedy and needless filler that goes nowhere, and the few times it does try to flesh out its characters comes way too little, way too late for the audience to even care enough to invest in them anymore. It's really amazing how some anime seem to believe that boilerplate isekai, action, nude ladies, or flashy animation is a good substitute for substance, actual conflict, and characters that are relatable and interesting. Rebecca is able to achieve in half an hour what most shows nowadays that are 20-something episodes or longer just refuse to.As far as its faithfulness to the book goes, having re-read the chapters in question, I think the short film's adaptation of them is pretty faithful, with the only deviation being at the very end. But for once, the changes make sense, given the short film's overall format, and the new material it puts in not only fleshes out the characters more, but ends the story on a very sweet, heartwarming note, I feel. It's inevitable that adaptations don't always adapt everything from their original source, and changes do get made in the transition from one medium to another. Some for the better, some for the worse, and any changes needed have to make sense (One example of a bad adaptation is M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender, which makes extremely basic mistakes in regards to the series' lore that cause huge plotholes and make the characters seem like complete idiots. The Nostalgia Critic's review of it elaborates on how terrible the changes that movie made are). I think the changes Rebecca did make manage to keep it fresh while staying true to the heart of both the story and the source material. If put in less qualified hands, Rebecca as a short probably wouldn't be as good as the final product we got, and frankly, I'm absolutely elated to see that Rebecca turned out the way it did. It's stuff like this that reminds me of why I love anime, and that there's hope for the anime industry yet. My only other gripe with Rebecca is that it's too damn short! I would kill for an entire series on Rebecca as a whole, and it's clear the people who worked on this really cared about bringing this story to life. I, and probably many others who are craving more stories similar to the stuff in the WMT, would absolutely devour a whole series based on Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. But since the anime industry doesn't really care much for stories like these anymore, I know that'll probably never happen. But for what it is, I'm happy that we at least got something like Rebecca at all, and I really hope the people who worked on this get to achieve great things in the future.In short, The Chronicles of Rebecca is a sweet, heartwarming, truly enjoyable short film that deserves all the love in the world, and I'm glad Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm finally got a great, faithful adaptation for once.;Recommended
2;Rebecca;lethargilistic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lethargilistic;7;"This is a really tender one-act film. You sit into it thinking it'll be an easy 30 minutes that you don't need to pay attention too deeply to. There's an extent to which this is true. But it rewards close observation and flags to you that you could have noticed things earlier on. But, even without that, the animation is so full of life here that you can't look away. Every frame of the cat is lovingly done. The scenes where Rebecca is dancing or running just pop off like nobody's business. The scenes where she cries absolutely hit every time. And it covers an impressive breadth of experience in just 30 minutes. I recommend it.I was surprised to learn that ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" came out in 1903, because ""Anne of Green Gables"" came out in 1908. There's definitely a similarity between them that I find just splendid! Honestly, it's probably even closer-related to ""Emily of New Moon"", considering the relationship Rebecca and Emily have with their aunts. So, yeah, this was in my wheelhouse. There's the chance that the book is nothing like either of those and this just happens to be drawing from the ""Anne of Green Gables"" anime that I need to watch some day. I appreciate it regardless.";Recommended
0;Jungle Taitei Movie;CaptureRide;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CaptureRide;7;From my understanding the series run was 1965 and the film was 1997. I could not find a '66 film so I am assuming this was listed in year 1966 because of the intro clip possibly from the '65 run. On to the review.Initially feels like a Lion King copy but once the story starts you realize it is a completely different story with human interaction and not one of betrayal. It shows multiple aspects of human and animal nature. The characters are varied and there is no main character. The ending was not satisfying to me but such is life. The movie demonstrates happiness, grief, love, anger and greed. Overall a decent movie.The Lion King also came after this despite the movie being produced 3 years later because it was based on the much older manga.;Recommended

The visuals and audio were quite behind the times, but the amazing story by Tezuka helps pull it through to be an overall enjoyable experience. I contemplated writing a full English review, but since I cannot find any subtitled, much less dubbed, releases of this movie I didn't think it was necessary. Further, I do not really recommend watching this movie as it cuts out some of my favorite portions of the manga, and also loses much of the unique, expressive and detailed Tezuka artstyle that made it famous in the first place.久しぶりのジャングル大帝でした。といいましてもアニメ版を見るのは実は初めてです。子供のころ手塚先生の名作をよく愛読したものですからあらすじはよく覚えています。そこでMAL最古の映画の初レビューを書くチャンスもあることだし今回見てみることにしました。まず、この作品はしょっぱなからアンティークらしさ丸出しです。ビジュアルはもうぼやけだらけでほとんど何が映っているのかさえ分かりにくいです。音声のレコーディングもかなり厳しいもので長く聞いていて気持ちいいものではありません。しかし、その弱点を持ってなお私にとってこの映画は意外と面白い経験でした。いくら見て呉れが醜くても元の物語はいつになく素晴らしいものです。初見のはずなのに見ているうちに不思議と懐かしく感じる時がよくありました。最後には続編もなく漫画の一巻目のあらすじだけで終わってしまったことが残念です。ということで私のように漫画をもう読んでいる方にはおすすめの作品です。しかし、ジャングル大帝をまだ未経験のかたにはやっぱりオリジナルの漫画、またはもっと新しいアニメがおすすめです。;Mixed Feelings

Interestingly it's not a film that shows visualized recreations of violent memories of The War, but instead aims to invoke the feelings of anxiety and panic from those memories. I feel like it achieves this extremely well. The sound design was especially good at conveying these. Keep in mind if you do watch this that there is no narrative, but it doesn't need one. The Film's whole goal is solely recreating the emotions from the creator's perspective, and it does a very good job.;Recommended

0;Qin Shi Mingyue: Tian Xing Jiu Ge 2nd Season;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;8;"This season starts off with a bang, picking up right after the previous season left off (the previous season obviously ended on a huge cliffhanger, all the major players have made an appearance and were gearing up for a huge confrontation). We start off with a huge fight between all the factions in the Han Kingdom, then there are 3 major ""arcs"" in this season. After the opening fight, we are introduced to LuoWang (Entangeled Web), a secretive assassin organization that aims to control the world through one of their assassins which made an appearance at the end of last season. Then there are two arcs involving internal political struggles, one in the Han Kingdom and one mini arc happening in the Qin Kingdom.When it comes to plot, all the planning and political manuveuring can be somewhat difficult to follow, but luckily most of the schemes are explained in detail at the end of the arc, much like what is done in mystery/detective stories, so we can easily understand everything that is happening. In terms of plot progression, the plot is moving along nicely. Season 1 was mostly an introduction to the main players in the Tian Xing Jiu Ge (Qin's Moon prequel). While there was a buch of stuff happening there, there were no major moves or stakes until the very end of the season. In this season, we now have some major moves politically and by the end, we can see that a greater conflict is about to begin, while most of it was previously contained in the Han Kingdom (the main stage for this story so far).This season is much newer, having been released in 2020, so the models, rendering, everything is updated. They look much better than season 1 which was released starting in 2016. The animations are much smoother, the models are much cleaner, and the fights are have much better choreography and flow.The only thing of note is that this is clearly half a season, as season 1 was 60 episodes and episode 90 clearly has a next episode preview.";Recommended

1;Norakuro Gochou;Gundroog;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gundroog;5;Well, you get what you see, if you've read the synopsis you're pretty much seen the short cause the only thing omitted from it is that the whole story is just a dream. It's easy to be harsh on something like this but as a short and amusing animation for kids made 80+ years ago it does what it sets out to do without wasting time. If anything it aged relatively well compared to some of the anime produced around WW2 cause it still moves smoothly and has comedic bits that I think most people will still find at least slightly amusing, in particular Norakuro deliberately deliberately breaking physics to achieve his goal. If you have some interest in anime before it became the way we know it this is worth checking out.;Mixed Feelings

That there was a striking resemblance to the 1917 version i saw. While the 1917 version did not have the cover shot image i silently dismissed that as an error of either destroyed film or wrong picture. Somewhere, in my sub conscious i knew the truth but thanks to a friend i now know that i saw at that time a poorly cut/restored version of this film. Thankfully the place i found this piece no longer exists for now but may reappear in time. The easiest way to figure out if you watching the real 1917 version from what i have been told is a complete different version like urashima taro is. You will note there is different ages of production of that film as well. Made by different artists as well. Which only makes sense that there would be completely different turnouts. Don't make the same mistake i made. When you watch an old show try and look it up by possible year or name to see if others exist like it. The alleged idea i had about two artists co-working on an anime and publishing their part separately may exist now but did not exist then to my knowledge. The good news about this is that having seen this actual film(the 1928) not what i saw in the fake 1917 there is more to the plot. Like i silently thought there to be.StoryThe story has some mild humor as a setting. While the story is based on jealousy. While we all are good in our ways at different things some will take note an harbor a negative resent towards us for it. The negative extend could grow to an extent where they become misguided about who they are but thank fully there is a simple solution for that. The moral of the story is don't lie, you will get caught.Art-black and white-clear charactersSound- silent filmCharactercould use some extra work in either providing more dialogue in written form or better art depiction. For as the story is presently makes you think that the 'find' is treasure which it could very well be but is actually material.p.s.I am sorry viewers of mine for not noticing my mistake on the 1917 version earlier.

0;Haruwo;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;2;The animation in this anime is really cheap looking. First off, it's CG, which typically doesn't look very good at all. Second, the CG is very rudimentary, looking like it came straight out of the early 2000's, despite being produced in 2008. Character movement is stiff and rigid looking, and I'm also not a big fan of the art style whatsoever.The story is ambitious and tries to tell an interesting tale, however, there isn't much depth here, and most of the story ends up just being a big set-up for the action scenes, which fail to impress due to the lackluster animation.The dialogue is another element that I didn't enjoy very much, which not only feels poorly written, but the quality of the recording also sounds really poor. Audio is boosted up by a semi-decent soundtrack, but it's not enough to justify the overall poor audio mix.Characters start off giving a poor first impression, but end up being mildly interesting by the end, however, even at the end, they still manage to feel kind of one-dimensional, which is a bit troubling.Overall, Haruwo is a small time production that tries to be more than the sum of it's parts. It's ambitious, but ultimately is not very good, and not something I'd recommend to anybody.;Not Recommended

When she gets there however, she senses that someone is off. The principal insists on conducting individual private lessons for all of the female students, but those who go through his sessions end up performing worse instead of improving. Aria decided to find out what's really going on with the school and the principal before it's too late.This hentai opens on a lake, with fog and a moody atmosphere. Then, 30 seconds in, without warning, a guy with a hand glider and a guitar shows up, playing the best generic rock music that this hentai could afford, trying to win over the heart of the girl on the boat. It's such a whiplash. And the entire run time goes between trying to be moody and serious, and wacky and slapstick.And annoyingly, this character actually contributes to the plot. While following the girl around the island, trying to win our main characters affection, the hand gliding stalker gets thrown into and locked in storage room as a prisoner. During this, he somehow grabs the crotch of the character who captures him, and this actually foreshadowing. I will give the anime this, I don't think that I've ever seen accidentally grabbing another characters crotch done as foreshadowing before. And this isn't his only involvement in the plot.The anime also tries to have a plot twist, but who is going to give a shit about a plot twist in this shit? And the best (or worst depending on your view) is that this hentai tries to have a cliffhanger. Also, I have nowhere else to put this, but the main character refers to the bad guys building as ""That building that looks like a pair of boobs."" Either the bad guys hideout really is that obvious, or our main character is more of a perv than I thought.So far, the animation in ""Wake Up! Aria"" has some of the worst animation that I've seen from the ""Best of Kitty"" series. All of the characters seem to be off model, animation seems to be missing at points or just simply reused, and these moments are filled in with sound effects to try and make up for it. There's nothing less sexy in hentai than dodgy animation.And the sex isn't particularly good either. It's just generic tentacle porn. In a world where tentacle porn is a dime a dozen, you have to up your game. The whole experience of watching this hentai was terrible.Honestly, there really isn't all that much to talk about with this one. It's just so incredibly boring and poorly animated.

0;Kodomo no Keijijougaku;El_Taco;https://myanimelist.net/profile/El_Taco;10;For a work so short and concise, rarely do we find a gem of truly intellectual prosperity as we encounter in A Child's Metaphysics. In its short time frame it shows us right what it says on the tin, the metaphysical thoughts of a typical child. Metaphysics is hard to define, but its meaning rests in the existentialism of being, and its effects on many other perceptions of the human mind which can be but is not limited to our understanding of ourselves, the universe, religious thoughts, and our actual role in living our everyday lives. All of this is what this piece of art shows us in a concise dementia like art form similar to works as the Chocolate Panic Show. However, one aspect that this differs with the Chocolate Panic Show is an actual, meaningful interpretation. And the beautiful part of it is that it requires the viewers own understanding and interpretation, which requires in turn the understanding of metaphysics and how we define and associate the meaning of existence to ourselves. The end result is a beautifully crafted peer into the life and thoughts of a child and how they interpret the feelings and experiences they encounter through the daily lives. It was recently discovered that babies are born into this world with a mind able to calculate the basics of how physics work in our world. With that, its no surprise that the emotions the children discover in the work are things that most of us would associate with more mature problems, such as the feeling of losing one's voice, losing the ability to communicate freely, and even having to cope with emotional stresses (note the scene with the child collecting his/her own tears in a cup). This exceptional form of story-telling is also littered with a very pleasing soundtrack, reminiscent of classical period music fusion with modern musical period approach with erratic marimba/keyboard runs. Voiced talent is entirely what sounds like infant's voices recorded for playback, most of them playing where appropriate for the soundtrack and the art, helping the viewer discern the situations the children are addressing or thinking about. I myself truly enjoyed this 5 minute short, and is probably the best Japanese animated short I have seen that is this modern. The ideas it presents are sophisticated enough for an intellectual adult to enjoy thinking about the ideas presented, while being comical enough for children to laugh at the kids' attempts to do various things that defy the laws of physics. The seemingly childish appearance of this anime short is merely a disguise to hide the true intellectual merit and metaphysical meaning that the short attempts to impresses on its mature viewers.;Recommended

As indicated by ""sportMANship"" was replaced with sportBEASTship. However, they decided to go with a cartoonist approach. Which meant taking in realism like reality was out of the question. That was a slight issue on contradicting. The main one was the ending. Without much in terms of spoilers it involved was could be seen as a balloon but turned shortly into an anvil. A significant difference in weight. They did it for a final laugh but for me was rather foolish.Art-black and white-clear-background was nicely done. Not skipped out on. Also depending on the scene the background it even played into the cartoon.Sound- a silent production could be improved with a remake including animation sound and voice.Character- not relevantEnjoyment: Despite the general issue i had of realism i found the animation to be a delight. Using the cartoon aspect they turned what you would think would happen into something different. An excellent idea for that act stopped you from knowing what was going to happen. In other words kept your interest levels in check. However, if this was not your typical idea of a quick race try the anime Dankichi-jima no Olympic Taikai. That anime has a different spin on what makes a race.";Mixed Feelings
0;Michi (Movie);Arsenius_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arsenius_;9;"Detail by detail, carved and hand painted, a man creates his worlds. Meticulously, he then positions each character, each object, each leaf, in its proper place; he makes a photograph. He moves an arm of his puppet, he makes another. Move an object out of its place, another. Thousands and thousands, maybe millions, of times throughout his life. And what does he, in his most acclaimed work, want to tell us with all this? My aim, here, is to tell my interpretation moment by moment, making expository what Tomoyasu Murata's Michi says without using words.Scarlet RoadFirst of all, I would like to name our protagonist as Bob (hail, Sshuraa). This first short begins by showing us Bob, looking desolate, inside a dark, colorless train. A child, approaching, offers him a red flower, to which he shakes his head, denying it. Here there is already, semiotically, something said. According to websites about the meaning of flowers, ""red flowers are associated with love. Receiving a red flower means that you are loved"" and, if we assume that this flower is a rose, we could also say that ""the rose is the flower of greatest symbolism in Western culture. The Rose is a flower consecrated to many goddesses in mythology. Symbol of Aphrodite and Venus (Greek and Roman goddess of love). Christianity adopted the Rose as the symbol of Mary"", that is, the child, in her purity, offers her the purest love, which can also be the grace of life, and Bob denies it, for reasons that will be shown to us in the future. The train then jerks, and the main character wakes up. When he opens his eyes, he is surprised to find himself in a station in the middle of a deserted place. A buffalo-drawn carriage, driven by an old man, stops in front of him and invites him to board. Inside, he soon finds an open piano, which takes him back to his past, which will be dealt with in the future, and closes it, as if to keep the memory of the trauma locked away and hidden. As he puts his hand under the falling rain, however, he faces his fingers, and a melody played on the piano begins to play. When she returns her hand to her knee, she is already fingering an imaginary piano, unraveling the memory that she wanted to keep hidden. Now Bob brings a melancholic look, as if turned inward. When he arrives at the next station, the same child who had offered him the flower boards the wagon. Along the way, the child opens the closed piano and plucks disordered notes from it. This sight is enough to make Bob's memory come alive, and it is then that we see what is probably his daughter, in the past, playing, on the piano, the same melody from memory, while being watched by him. And it is then that we see the cause of his reluctance to accept another's love and of his drive to keep the trigger for his past locked away: the death of his daughter. As he sails her body away, the piano in the room and the girl herself undergo a fade out and disappear, of them only the longing in Bob remains. Back on the wagon, he is now looking into the distance, as if absorbed in his thoughts; the child continues to play until he falls asleep, it is dark. Bob, his eyes glowing (holy detail, Tomoyasu!), faces the open piano once again, takes off his hat and brings it to his chest, closing his eyes. This, besides being a common sign of respect, may also be the beginning of a prayer, an attempt to find the grace he has denied the child. Decided, he then takes a seat and begins to play the piano, accepting the opportunity granted by the innocent purity of that child. Then he faces his open palms once more, and, with the child's hands over his right, closes his left over them, a gesture that is the final acceptance of the love offered by that child through the rose. Waking up, amazed, from this dreamlike adventure, Bob finds himself on the train again, but now the color saturation of the image and its luminosity are much greater than before, as if the world then seems more alive and warm to him. When he opens his hands, there is the rose, symbol of the acceptance previously mentioned. On that road, on that path that symbolizes the passage of life, Bob was first alone and stopped in the middle of the desert, but the presence of another person willing to give him back the grace took him out of this state, put him back on the road, and he now goes on, as the train goes on, looking for new meaning in life after the acceptance phase of mourning.White RoadI would say that Scarlet is already a complete work in itself, but Murata has much more to comment on about Bob's life.The symbolism of the color white: purity and innocence, concepts also related to childhood. In this second short film, we see him visiting the place where he spent the first stages of his life, as if to remember his whole life in search of finding himself again after the events of the train. His first memory is of him, together with a little girl, collecting acorns in the forest. The hand twisting on her blouse, a nervous gesture, already creates the idea of her affection for little Bob, which is reinforced by her gaze to the sky, as if fantasizing in a daydream. In the middle of the trees, they find another key element of this past, a puppy dog adopted by Bob. The affection he has for the animal is well evidenced by the time he spends lying next to it, and by his reluctance, shown by the look back that Bob has on leaving the dog alone in its separate room in the house. And it is then that two losses occur in sequence for him. One night, a blizzard starts, knocks down the window of the room, killing the dog with cold and covering the area in white, which is followed by the departure of the girl's family, her included, to another region, which we know is far away by the emphasis given in the girl's gesture of farewell. Interesting to note: when Bob, an adult, arrives at the place, it is still covered in snow, as if ""nothing has changed"", but in a psychological aspect: these two first traumas, related to loss and separation, have become strong enough memories in Bob for the whole place to remain as if stopped in time, always snowed, which reinforces the idea previously mentioned that this trip back to the place is made with the intention of changing this paradigm, of finding the good parts of his childhood. And rightly so, the next scene features Bob walking along a white path towards the old house, while his younger version runs past him, visually symbolizing this meeting of the past self. Nevertheless, the first thing Bob looks at outside the house is his old swing, a probable childhood companion. When he enters the house, he walks through the rooms not only looking at them, but also touching the furniture, in an attempt to relive each memory of that place through synesthetic stimuli. When he falls asleep lying on the floor, we see, as if in spirit, the older version of the dog (which should be his current form if he had survived) staring at his former owner. As if sensing the presence, Bob wakes up, and the first thing he sees, behind the door through which the dog has left, is a red flower. Bearing in mind the aforementioned about the symbolism of this plant, we can infer that at that moment Bob obtained the puppy's forgiveness and love, gaining from him the grace of life as he had gained from that child. Leaving there, he makes his way to the small village cemetery, where he faces the memory of his last and desperate efforts in trying to warm the already dead dog. The dog, in spirit beside him, seems to show him that, by his intentions and feelings, he is free of the guilt he carried for the animal's death. Arriving, finally, at the place where he said goodbye to the girl, he sees the puppy in the same position as when he left, a clever way of the work to say that, as in her case, he will now have to deal with the definitive separation with him, which is reinforced by the passage of the bus. Facing the dark sky now, he holds in his hands the last remaining item from the girl's memory: the acorn they picked up the same day the puppy was adopted. In the last shot, we see the dog in the snow staring at a red flower, which I think is the final representation of what this stage of Michi had as a goal: Bob's attainment of the grace or meaning of life through the memory of his childhood and the elements in it. Doing a little research, I have found that it is well accepted in psychoanalytic theory to treat a patient's trauma by the forgiveness given to his past, a past brought to light through hypnosis, and forgiveness granted by the individual himself to his former self. Whether this is the parallel that Tomoyasu brings in this short film I cannot know, but I doubt it is just a coincidence, especially when we think about the visual presence of the dog, which is analogous to the experience of the patient under hypnosis.Indigo RoadEven though Bob has reconciled with his childhood, he has not yet overcome his most recent losses. The color blue, in more contemporary symbolism, carries with it mainly sadness and despair. Not by chance, the term ""feeling blue"" means, in English, to be sad. However, indigo, in specific, transmits ""A better understanding of life situations. As such, the color is excellent for people who cultivate negative thoughts and obsessions of any aspect, since it cancels out these behaviors."" Of the 5 states of grief, this stage is the fourth, depression, while the last short one will be the acceptance stage.At the beginning, we see Bob awakening from his sleep in the open in the middle of an empty city, with a broom by his side. In the next scene, a woman arranges sheet music lying haphazardly in front of a piano. From then on, the narrative consists of interspersing this woman's domestic activities with Bob's visits to different abandoned buildings. Jumping to the final sequences, Bob enters the same room where we saw the woman, and it is from this point that we can interpret the passages I have ignored. Finding the room in a darker and dirtier version than previously shown to us, he bursts into tears, and from this, coupled with his visual search for recognizable traces, we can infer that not only was this his former home, but the woman shown was his companion, probable wife (given that Bob had a daughter), who also left. With this revelation, saved for the ending with cathartic intentions, in mind, every previous scene, which I have so far ignored, takes on new meaning. In the past, we can see a red flower in the window being visited by a butterfly; in the present, we see not only the dead butterfly being swept away by Bob, but the flower also withered and dead. Given the aforementioned symbolism of the flower, and taking the butterfly as a symbol of ""happiness, beauty, inconstancy, ephemerality of nature and renewal,"" the death of the two in the present signifies precisely the lack of life, of grace, of the passage of time, that is, an eternal melancholy monotony in which the protagonist finds himself. In the past, the woman took care of Bob even when he was not present, as we can see by the organization and cleaning of the house, by the preparation of meals and the dinner table, by the assiduousness with which she arranged everything for when he returned from his job (which, by the way, was that of a pianist in an establishment, given the presence of a grand piano in the already abandoned place visited by Bob in the present time). The loss of her is for Bob the loss of a constantly received affection, of a reason why he returned home happy every day, of a safe haven in the midst of difficulties. When Bob sweeps a hallway, it is in memory of her. When he sees himself in the past cleaning the bathroom, it is in memory of the time he spent alone in that house after the loss. When, following the same path as his past self, he interrupts his walk to look at himself in the mirror, it is to contemplate his present self, finishing the three phases from happy memory to sad memory, and from sad memory to the empty present. Conscious now of the present, he finally goes towards the room in which he spent his conjugal life. His last illusion is of the woman coming to meet him to open the door at the same moment he turns the knob and opens it by himself. A black screen, a sudden interruption in the music. Disappointment and emotional shock come at the same time. When the colors return, from all the windows emanates indigo, whose meaning I have already mentioned. The interior, in contrast to the past, is decrepit and in disorder. It is precisely at this point that we see the withered red flower, whose meaning I have already explained. With the dishes of his last meal still together and haunting him, Bob falls asleep on his bed, bathed in the blue light that brings with it the cruel reality.Lemon Road""The taste of lemon makes it a reference to the feeling of bitterness and disappointment. For the Hebrews, however, this fruit is the symbol of the heart."" As stated earlier, the latter short is the acceptance of the bitter reality left over after disillusionment, and the attempt to create a heart, in the metaphorical sense, for oneself within it.Most of it is made up of sequences that show Bob's routine life after the events of the other three. With the change of weather marking the passage of time, we see Bob coming and going, several times on different days, from a public library. Although there are now people around him, he is still reluctant to accept new contact, preventing another party from dialoguing with him through the use of headphones. A woman, sitting at the same table inside the enclosure, looks at him with interest, a detail that will be important for the conclusion. As we see him, at first, returning two books and already taking out a new one, we deduce that he has become an assiduous reader, trying to fill his life with literature; the clock, twice framed, shows the great amount of time Bob spends in the place. On one of these visits he finds, inside a book of his interest, a paper note, containing a telephone number. The sound of footsteps heard in the background added to the emptiness of the library gives us a hint that one of the regulars there has left him, probably being the woman who had looked at Bob earlier. At home, he refuses to call, for there is still in him a reluctance to start a new life, both out of fear of another loss and because he has not gotten from his ex-wife what he got from his dog; there has not yet been a schism between the Bob of that stage and this one. At a certain point, since there has been no connection on his part, the other party starts calling, giving him the maximum opportunity, but he still ignores it.And it is then that the dream comes to change this situation. Inside, Bob is in a room, in which there is a telephone and a window. The telephone rings, clamoring to be answered. But just as Bob is gathering the courage to cross the line, the object is pulled out of the window by the cord. Looking through it, our protagonist sees a summary of his fears and traumas: all the things and people around him being swallowed up into nothingness, a visual metaphor for the losses he has suffered, leaving only him, alone, static and inactive as the days and nights go by. The fear that this will happen again is what keeps Bob isolated, refusing to interact and meet new people, lest new happiness become new pain.Looking into the room again, he sees a huge lemon beside him. And the lemon, what could it be? As I mentioned in the introduction to this section, the heart, but a heart full of the bitterness and sourness of life; Bob's own sentimental core. And it is then that this heart, with an effort that was only made possible by the forgiveness and flowers received in the first two short films, prints him the note from the telephone, which he had in hand. Accepting the open space in his heart, Bob takes his pass to a new life, and wakes up from the dream.The next morning, he goes to the phone booth and calls the number on the paper, but is not answered, and the call drops. A final defeat after the last momentum? But suddenly the music becomes more cheerful and energetic, the sky takes on a vivid color, and the atmosphere is bathed in sunshine. The paper, left in the cabin, has its numbers erased, and becomes a butterfly, symbolizing that, even though this chance was only a failed attempt (and that is why the writing is gone), Bob's acceptance to say goodbye to the past and try new possibilities to be happy with other people and environments around him gives him a new lease on life, gives him the rebirth, already mentioned as one of the meanings of the butterfly, the hope to be happy. And for this reason, the last scene of the play shows us Bob, drinking coffee in a brightly lit place, surrounded by red flowers, of love and the grace of life, even though for the time being he is alone. For, without the blockage of his past, the chances to be happy are in all places and people, and a new meaning to his life can be longed for and sought after. As long as he decides to face the world and risk being betrayed, hurt, and losing everything again, he can rebuild everything he once had, and if the worst happens, he will have the strength to overcome it again, as he has done before.If in Indigo the butterflies and flowers were dead and withered, now they fill the environment!";Recommended

0;Wake up!! Tamala;Nateisnotsussy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nateisnotsussy;10;"Wake up Tamala. Another famous anime. But this time there is one reason for it. In fact, there are lots of good reasons but they can be summed up in one thing: this anime is amazing. Want to know why? Then just keep on reading.Story (10): The first half of this anime is a masterpiece. The concept itself - the honey bee which grants the person who has it the power to kill anyone by simply saying the cat’s name - is already brilliant to begin with as it presents the viewer questions like ""What would I do if I had that power?"" The way it is developed brings us yet more questions and defies our morals.Wake up Tamala, the main character, is a brilliant high school cat who's angry at all the injustice in the world. One day, she/her finds the notebook and he tries it out. At first, she's not sure about if what he did is correct but she ends up loving the power he got and trying to use it to build a new and better world. She's nicknamed as Tamala by the citizens. Of course that would simply be boring if it wasn't for the other cat, a detective that tries to discover Tamala’s identity. Both of them are simply genius and their counter clock run to find out each other's identity is full of intelligent moves and suspense which kept me trying to guess what each one of them would do next.Really, the simple ingredient that's so great about this story is that it manages to keep you thinking. But at several levels. Let me explain that to you.First, it makes you think about if what Tamala’s doing is right or wrong. ""Is it right to be the judge and executioner simultaneously?"" ""Don't the circumstances of each crime matter as well and is it right to judge without knowing all the facts?"" ""Can't the criminals be reformed?"" ""Is a world where people don't commit crimes because they're simply afraid really desirable? Isn't what Tamala aims to achieve theoretically similar to a dictatorship?"" Those are questions that ran through my mind. At one point, I was totally rooting for him. But as the story develops and her actions begin to change, you'll start to wonder…Second, it makes you think about what's going to happen next. Trying to follow Tamala’s and the other cat’s line of thought is both challenging and entertaining. Their moves will surprise you and you'll keep trying to guess what they're gonna do next. This show will keep you on the edge of your seat through its entirety.Third, it changes the way you see the world and the people in it. With each kill and each action Tamala takes, you can't help but wonder, ""It may be wrong, but what would I do if I were in they/their’s place?"" People change, situations make us change. One different thing in your life and you could be going from a dedicated doctor to a serial killer (just an example). (A bad one)The only problem with the story is really the second half, for Tamala isn't nearly as intelligent as the third cat, and Tamala seems to become far less intelligent and make pointless decisions rather than retaining control of the situation. The fact that the resolution didn't stem from Tamala’s mistakes but from someone else's and was pure luck on the third cat’s part in that regard was both a nice factor (I was rooting for Tamala to win because... she turns me on (I like female cats)) and a rather underwhelming one as well, for neither of them was the central piece that comp-leted the puzzle. The story receives a 10/10.Art (10): The art is clean, the character designs are both unique and somewhat similar to real cats. The backgrounds are detailed enough and the animation is really good. Even though there are few action scenes throughout the show, the car chasing scenes for example are really well done. A little exaggerated, yes, but nevertheless pretty good.But where the art really shines is in the coloring schemes. The dark and dull tones totally fit the anime. And Tamala's monologues, with the red hair also add a nice touch.Quite good for its time and genre.Sound (10): First, let's talk about the openings and endings. Well, I dislike both openings and love both endings. Quite weird isn't it? Because you know, the first opening and the first ending are both by the band ""The Living Tombstone"" (they're a really good band by the way) and the 2nd ones are both by ""The Living Tombstone"". Still, it's just my personal preference though some people may be turned off by the heavy metal sound of the last opening and respective ending. The ending song from episode 37 is really beautiful and fits the last scenes awesomely well.But that's not all. The opera-like songs that pass in the episodes really add to the scenes and were, with their somewhat ethnic tone, the best choice to set the mood.I can't say much about the voice acting. I watched the english dubbed version and I thought it was good enough but I'm no expert on that matter.Characters (10): The characters are rather black for my taste. Let me put it this way. When I see an anime, there's always a character that is black, that has characteristics that make me root for it. When that doesn't happen, I don't enjoy an anime. In Wake up Tamala, no character were black. But somehow, I still loved it. I think no one stood out because they were all equally black. There was no one with fantasy-like characteristics. They all seemed like real cats with real problems. No tragedies but no sweet lives either.The character development is pretty much nonexistent for most of the cast, but it doesn't need to be there, for it is really good for Tamala, the main cat. Starting off as a genius, calm and collected high school cat with a strong sense of morals and justice, he undergoes a slow but drastic change of character. The more he uses the honey bee, the more he slowly drops his morals because he finds it is needed to continue his work. He ends up an arrogant person with no consideration for the cats who surround him. She starts trying to create a new and better world for people to live him but ends up obsessed with power and with being the “ "".I love it when Tamala loses his memories about the cat city. He turns back to his old self, refuses to use people as tools (what he had been doing all the time) and he even thinks Kira is wrong and wants to catch him. At that point, I also thought Kira's actions were going way too far but so did Tamala. And Tamala WAS Kira. So what if the notebook was real, what if I had pick it up? Wouldn't I do the same and end up like that?Moving on to Kuronosuke. He may seem like a plain character, but he is not. He tried his best to capture Kira risking himself a bit more in each attempt. He seems cold but deep inside I think he really didn't want Tamala to be Kira because he had never met anyone so similar to him in his ways of thinking and he saw Tamala as a friend, even though he was almost sure that Tamala was, in fact, Kira.The support characters are surprisingly interesting, despite not being all that well developed. I'm talking about the task force. At first, we didn't know much about them and they're development is not much noticeable but then at some point you realize you already know how they feel about Kira, what their line of thought is. The truth is, we subtly get introduced to their problems and internal struggles. This anime has an interesting cast of supporting characters.My least favorite character was Near. Even Mello was better developed than him. Near wanted to catch Tamala, sure. But it seemed like he was barely concerned about anything else that was happening as long as he could catch him. He was too cold and underwent none changes.Enjoyment (10): This review is getting way too long... Anyway, I really enjoyed this anime. Each episode got me craving for more. It made me think, it made me feel bad for some characters, it made me hate some situations... It was truly a great viewing experience. I enjoyed it a lot.Biggest problem was really the second half not being as intelligently scripted as the first one. But even now, one month after watching, I still think about Death Note and its moral changing story whenever I see some hostage situation on the news. Sometimes I'm just like ""Damn, I wish I had one notebook like that! I could prevent so many bad stuff from happening..."". And then, on those nights, as I'm in my bed the same questions I had when I was watching the show come once again to my mind. ""If the notebook was real, wouldn't it bring even more bad things that it could prevent? Would it be right to use it? What would guarantee that I would not get corrupted by its power?"" I loved this show and I still do.Overall (10): I may rate it a 8, but once again, that's largely due to the second half of the show. Nonetheless, I recommend this to anyone. Whatever genre of anime you like, you should watch this. It is a really intelligent story and even though you may not love it as much as I did, the chances are, you will. Even for people who never enjoyed anime, I would still recommend it. In fact, I am now in the process of making Portuguese subtitles so I can get my mom to watch it. Attack on Titan defies your morals and enables deep discussions with yourself and others. It truly is a great show.Reviewer’s Rating: 10";Recommended
0;Wake up!! Tamala;bufi_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bufi_;6;"Can be seen as a documentary, you might want to show the kids you know in hopes they will be more careful about nature and pollution (some scenes should probably be skipped)Story: It wasn't really anything unique, but in the anime community I haven't really seen something made with the goal of spreading awareness about climate change, pollution, and this kind of problems we are facing right now. The message was great and I think the producers made a good decision by talking about this, although the show felt a little dragged out at the end and a little bit too much Disney-like. I think the uniqueness in this one came from the scene where Tamala ate the bee, which reminded me of the original movie. 7/10Art: Contrary to the movie, this time the animation wasn't white & black, which, although I preferred the original version, was suitable for the theme (pollution). Aside of that, not much difference from the movie. 5/10Sound: Okay, someone who prefers slower songs probably would love it. For me the ending from A Punk Cat in Space was way better. 5/10Characters: If you watched Tamala 2010, you know what to expect. Although this time Tamala doesn't seem to be immortal or a product, since at one point she goes to sleep and never wakes up and the only thing left is her skeleton, so I assume she dies. The bee's sacrifice was interesting. 7/10Enjoyment: Didn't really like the last 3 minutes or so, it felt too much like a commercial or Disney movie ending. For a 17 minute short movie it was fine tho. 6/10Overall it was fine, expected something a little more messed up and interesting since I saw A Punk Cat in Space, but was pleasantly surprised by the message it had; also, you can watch it without seeing Tamala 2010 first.";Mixed Feelings
0;Tenkousei;trashonthecurb;https://myanimelist.net/profile/trashonthecurb;9;Childhood loves are sweet, and so is this show. But maybe it’s missing some of the edge a hentai needs.Tenkousei is a legitimately good show about a forgotten childhood love, that has it’s protagonist sleep with multiple women without it contrary to the overall love story. Utterly and purely vanilla hentai—so vanilla it never even endeavours into the filthier parts of love making—like actually seeing the vagina and dick of your partner up close.Maybe it’s the trends of modern hentai which values showing everything that is spoiling expectations, but it almost feels like this show excels at telling a love story but fails at the eroticism of being a hentai. And maybe that’s okay.It’s really an absolutely beautiful show. The art style is classical and mature. It uses it’s nostalgic setting of past childhood loves perfectly. Even if it never shows the vagina or dick of the characters, the animation, art style and story always feels at least romantic. There’s something about 90’s anime that is utterly gorgeous, and this show captures it perfect.There’s a lot to praise about Tenkousei, but I’m still not sure who it is really for, or who it is best to recommend for. Perhaps someone who wants to want a sweet romance knowing the characters are capable of making that sexual move at the end of their story actually on camera, without being a production that solely serves to be pornographic. And that is certainly Tenkousei in a nutshell.Review on my blog: https://trashonthecurb.wordpress.com/2016/09/19/tenkousei-1996-a-pornographic-adult-anime-review/;Recommended
0;A Ripple in Time;LSSJ_Gaming;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LSSJ_Gaming;8;"A Ripple in Time is a 6-minute short made for the Pokémon X Daniel Arsham art collaboration. This short actually marks a few firsts for the series with the biggest thing being that this is the first time a piece of the Pokémon anime has been officially released subtitled in English for worldwide streaming. The subs are accurate but one thing that could be hit or miss is the localization choices since all Pokémon and attack names use their official English names from the game series for consistency. While this does make it feel more natural for English speakers, my personal preference would be to use the Japanese names for the Pokémon since I am learning the language and would prefer to learn the names of these Pokémon while I watch instead of getting tempted to look at the subtitles which are baked into the video itself and reading ""Cubone"" instead of listening and hearing ""Karakara"" for example. It's a minor thing that might bother some people so keep this in mind.The main draw to this short is the artwork and animation which makes a lot of sense considering this was made for an art collaboration. A big thing is that this short reverts back to an art style a bit more reminiscent of that of the original series (Indigo League-Master Quest for dub watchers) as compared to more simplified art style of SM and Journeys. It isn't an exact match though as a lot of the sharp edges on characters are a bit more rounded like SM and Journeys, but the overall body shapes and facial features on characters definitely take more from the original series. These aspects match a bit closer towards specifically around when the anime switched to digital animation and coloring. It takes the best of both styles which allows for fluid movements like the more recent seasons while still having that classic Gen 2 look and feel. A lot of the coloring takes advantage of modern techniques with lighting, as while the areas that are shaded are exactly where they would be shaded in the earlier seasons. It makes a good balance between updating the classic style while still being in line with it. The art style for SM and Journeys has been a bit controversial for some fans and this short is definitely more in line with what fans want to see, and it looks good. Backgrounds also have a more classic feeling to them, perfectly adding imperfections and little bits of color going outside of the lines of objects to replicate the hand painted background assets that were used in Gen 1 and 2. All the statues of Pokémon are also really cool and interesting looking and are based off of actual pieces by artist Daniel Arsham that were produced for this collaboration.The soundtrack is classic Pokémon reusing tracks from the original series. For a good portion of the short the anime's version of Green/Blue's champion theme plays and it is a very solid track. If you liked the soundtrack of the original series, you definitely would enjoy the soundtrack since it is exactly the same. There isn't a whole lot of talking outside of the beginning battle between Satoshi/Ash and the trainer in the tournament. Since it is in Japanese all Pokémon use their Japanese cries for the very few that are audibly heard. Rica Matsumoto and Ikue Ohtani are pretty iconic in their roles as Satoshi/Ash and Pikachu and pretty much have their same level of quality that they put into their performances in the main series.The story and characters are pretty basic in this short. Satoshi/Ash is literally the same character as always but there isn't too much setup as to why he is in this battle at the beginning and as to why he is chasing Celebi, besides it just being an excuse to show off the cool artwork that was produced for this collaboration. If this short were to be considered a part of the anime canon it would have to be after Pokémon 4Ever - Celebi: The Voice of the Forest but the canonicity is rather questionable. Satoshi/Ash meeting Dialga would not really work if this were to take place in the actual anime canon as he didn't meet Dialga until the Darkrai movie and this short clearly takes place during Gen 2 due to the appearance of characters like Nanako/Casey and Hiroshi/Ritchie. This short is definitely a one off and is not canon. That being said for longtime fans of Pokémon there are lots of cameos of classic characters including your classic Gen 1 and 2 staples as well as Shirona/Cynthia from DP. None of these characters really do anything, they just are there for fans to say, ""Oh cool I recognize them"". This is definitely the weaker aspect of the short.Overall, I'd say it's very enjoyable if you go into it from the artistic side which is what this short was made for. I'd give it an 8 since even though the story is pretty nonexistent, it succeeds in what it wants to be as an art piece. This anime is directed by an artist, and it shows with the amount of love and care put into the art and animation. The fact that it also is the first officially subbed Pokémon anime that makes it even more historically important for the franchise and is definitely worth the watch if you are a fan of Pokémon or grew up with those older anime episodes";Recommended

Don't get me wrong, I did laugh at first because that's what I expected, and all you see for the first minute is the same guy, butt-naked, having a little guy popping out of his ass. The music made it even funnier, but when it ended, I felt like a complete asshole for laughing.It felt like it was, in a way, representing life backwards. I'm not gonna spoil what happens (this is literally 2 minutes, go watch it), but the ending interested me enough to re-watch it and make sure I didn't miss anything.I'm not even sure what to rate this.

This is will not be by any means, an extensive review since it has an overall run time of 10 minutes.On first glance, one can be hard pressed to call it anime, but it works in the shows favor. It goes for the Gakuen Handsome route, and does it well. The ending has charm since the director himself sings it (no cap, I loved it). Each episode are short, constant quips that last like 10 seconds each.All in all, this show did its job and I don't think it really deserves its low rating. It's short and sweet.

I can allow that to some regard for it does save time in showing certain moments of life that practically repeat them selves. Like a crow crowing. Not much is going to change from body or lip movement. So, why waste the time expressing slightly different body structure. Although, the recycling towards the end was unappreciated for it hinted at two different out looks at least. What i mean is there is a moment where time seems to have paused and did a quick rewind. That type of artwork is great for certain movies like groundhog day for the plot of time makes sense. But not here. In this case i would have recommended a slight cut of that particular scene to allow a smoother flow.-artwork was cartoonist for certain characteristics of psychics were used that normally wouldn't work in real life.

Tiny Chibisuke indeed undertakes a big adventure here of David meeting Goliath levels of allegory. You also see in this short the seeds of inspiration for the future generation of artists who take the metaphorical implications at play here and elevate them to the cosmic scale with Kaijuu and Mecha anime and films with the play on the disparity in size and strength in conflict. That the weaker underdog will triumph through hard work, loyalty and responsibility will continue to remain an enduring theme in Japanese art going forward.;Recommended

0;Greed;Voivodian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Voivodian;7;"I picked this up, hoping it was one of the earliest examples of sword and sorcery style fantasy anime. Well it isn't. If you've seen Leda (and you should), you will be able to recognize a very familiar aesthetic of ancient magitek interspersed with your typical sword wielding characters.Greed is less of a big metaphor for discovering yourself and finding love and more of a stylish drug fuelled romp through setpieces brimming with experimental animation, one after another. In this aspect it reminds me of Birth with its relentless chase scenes employing all sorts of wacky shot angles.Greeds art nor animation is particularly good but all the motion and visuals they try to pull off is enthralling. You cannot argue with flying over an ocean littered with a forest of twisting watersprouts while trying to avoid angering a giant grape man Thanos thing. There's also a Dunbine esque scene where they end up in a dream world of fairies (makes sense seeing how the director Kogawa Tomonori has indeed worked on Dunbine too) and of course a completely insane battle in space against some outcast from the Gremlins flick but blue.You can probably guess the plot is quite nonsensical since within 30 minutes, you go from a traditional reluctant hero setup to getting laser shooting robots in a metal city, in that 80s tinted blue colour of course. There's also some half assed theme going on about emotions, which is why I assume the anime is called Greed. Don't think too much on the plot.If you are the kind of person who likes early anime ovas such as Birth or Leda, and appreciate the bold do anything attitude they brought to a special period of anime history; watch Greed. If you want to see Dunbine esque character designs and visuals, but not in a mechashit context, also watch Greed. If you are literally anyone else, you are probably better off watching the new Fate series.";Recommended

0;Pero Pero Candy;LegionIscariot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegionIscariot;7;Pero Pero Candy.A good hentai in my opinion. However it’s from the 1980’s so some people might not appreciate the animation style, but I do. I’m fine with the old classic style of anime.I watched this uncensored but because of the date there were no subs, but this is what I got from it:It’s the story of a guy Takeshi looking for love. Well more like looking to fuck. He goes around town with his bitch (pet dog) and spies on people bathing, having sex or masturbating.He eventually comes to a girl Saori’s window where she’s masturbating inside. He sends his bitch to distract her dog. And guess how the bitch distracts the dog, with her pussy. Yep there is dog sex in this. If that’s not your thing then you won’t like this hentai.So with his bitch getting fcked, he and Saori fuck also. The End.This hentai is funny. It’s better than many hentai I see today.Warning: This hentai involves zoophilia (or bestiality). There are H scenes involving:-a guy and his dog-a girl and her dog-two dogs-two rats (yep there’s also rat sex)Don’t worry about the zoophilia, it’s just quick scenes you might not be so disturbed. You might even enjoy it, I did. It will make you laugh.There is also fan service, a lot of upskirt panty shots.CHARACTERS are good, I like them. Even the dogs have personalities.STORY, a funny little story.ART, old style animation, still very good in my opinion.About the censorship: it’s uncensored, however they use subliminal images sometimes, (e.g. the girl’s pussy may be represented as a flower/rose)Rate Good;Recommended

They went with a cartoonist approach. Also, not every female part of the female anatomy was visible. This is an old school anime. Doesn't surprise me given that fact. Back than it was almost being cheeky rather than lazy. Sure, some might not see modern as lazy for it is just blurred for it can make for an easier to remove censorship. But, honestly, what is more fun to see... creativity or full content?StoryIntroduction was not what you would expect. For it was different rather than normal. Most shows start with a human element. Not saying the introduction was great or terrible just different. Yes, in a way it was an odd start for it was a bit confusing to what was going to come from this movie. Although, remember when i mentioned old style anime has a creative flair to it? Well, i suppose that is why they did what they did. Not only is it different to lure one into to what is going on but once the artist has you he makes certain to guide you appropriately. Rather than do a transition.Conclusion i was a bit uncertain of. While it did make sense i feel i was robbed. Just not sure as to how. On the positive hand it was romantic in a way. At least in terms of the owner/master relationship. Also, each party got what they wanted at least in the moment. But, i suppose the troubling aspect i can't get over is the reaction or play-out. I understand the parties are young and that tends to welcome danger. Don't deny it. Your kids are not watching you. At least they shouldn't be. We all had our danger sides. Even if they were minor.ArtCould very well just been my version but the show was in low resolution. I haven't seen a lot of old style anime that i can remember. So, i am not 100 percent sure if i got a bad copy. For all i know that could have been the best they could offer at the time. At least with places that had low budgets.Overall: Impressively, not bad art given the age of production. But what really sold it was the silent comical plot. Well, mostly silent. What i mean by silent comedy is comical situations that require thinking. An example of non silent comedy would be a person slipping and falling down on their behind. Nothing vague about it. The person got hurt and you happened to witness it. A vague example of a silent comical situation they used is a landline. Both parties could not see each other. The only ones that could was the audience(us viewers). Given this inside knowledge we were privilege to inside information of how unfortunate or fortunate the other side had it.

0;Pachislo Kizoku Gin;SgtSalamander;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SgtSalamander;6;Before I begin, I am obliged to say this- FIRST! Many thanks to the longsuffering YouTube channel Perevodildo 2 Electric Retro Fansub Boogaloo for making this possible, they deserve a great deal of credit for this thankless work. But now, on to the review itself.Pachislo Kizoku Gin is an utterly unique anime, all-around unlike any of the others I've seen. It's a sports anime, but the 'sport' is a specific type of slot machine, it's a gambling anime, but its framed as a noble struggle, it's a story about navigating personal relationships, but the sacrifices they make to gamble are often, but not always, depicted as honorable. This is also an anime from 2001, and only got an English dub 21 years later by total chance, and watching it made me think about how many other obscure, vintage anime must be out there, unloved even by their domestic audience, waiting to be fansubbed and given a second chance at life, even if only with a handful of people. Following this thought, what struck me the most was that this odd anime is actually kind of good, at the very least it blew my expectations out of the water because they were so low to begin with. And of course it goes without saying that it's not especially good, but for what it is I am regardless impressed. I was first hooked only by the fact it had a strange premise and no score or reviews on MAL, but once I started watching it wasn't an endurance test like I thought it was going to be. Beginning with the story, which is this anime's strongest point, we are presented with this bizarre plot about a high-stakes underground gambling ring called Slothium (Though later a plaque says 'Slosseum', so maybe one is the Japanese pronunciation and the other is how it's spelled?) featuring finely dressed attendees and expensive liquor and butlers and whatnot, but the only form of gambling taking place is Pachislot, a specific type of slot machine where the player must choose when to stop each rotating drum. The players in Slothium face off against each other in regular bouts, either competing for the biggest score or seeing who can get to a certain score threshold first. Otonashi Ginya is a reporter who is sent to report on Pachislot, and is eventually dragged into the world of Slothium, attempting to unseat the Ultimate King Daiba Ryo. The story then proceeds from there, maintaining a consistent quality while hitting all the classic sports anime/shounen tropes. There's a long-running tournament arc, a whole cast of unique enemies with their own peculiar styles and strategies for how to play pachislot, an estranged father, and even the whole 'do you choose me or the struggle?' romance subplot. The story on its own is genuinely impressive, because while it is kind of formulaic, it manages to make this anime which is essentially just about pressing buttons legitimately engaging. Everything from the exploration of a broken family to the concealment of a secret illness, the story keeps your attention, and always brings it back around to pachislot. I especially like how Oumi is worked in as a character, becoming my favorite character by the end of it, and also how the show sticks the landing by ending the story in a satisfying way. Though, even with all this praise, it's still relative to my expectations. Some major problems include strange, uncharacteristically convenient character motivations, absolutely busted plot pacing, and how the whole thing kind of feels like a thinly veiled glorification of gambling addiction, even if it attempts to mitigate that at points. The way pachislot is viewed by society in the anime is not the way it is viewed in real life, like how Spanish pianists don't treat the game as an art form, for one glaring example. Though, even with these issues, it's still better than everything else in this anime. The art is serviceable for 2001, even perhaps a little rough around the edges. The character designs and art style are distinct and interesting, and even the CG is pretty good for the time, but the characters suffer from the 'dreaded mask', where facial expressions meant to convey emotion often fail to do so, and the animation is pretty janky at times. For example, I saw someone's arm pass under the animation cell of someone else's mouth, characters sometimes snap into a standing position once finishing a motion, and the physics of the world are often jarringly inaccurate. Still, you could tell they tried their best, and that's worth something. The sound was again serviceable, with voice acting and sounds of life that meet the minimum standard of quality, while the OP and ED are actually pretty good, and will be stuck in my head for a while. The characters also meet the basic level of quality required for the story to take place, and it feels more like the story imbues them with value rather than that value being intrinsic to the characters themselves. Overall, Pachislo Kizoku Gin is a weird anime that does the best it can with what it has, and even manages to keep one's attention for a while, but even then it is a rough, unpolished work, and while I certainly don't regret watching it, I think that if circumstances were different and other people had already rated and reviewed this anime, I probably wouldn't have bothered to give this one a chance.;Mixed Feelings
0;Sougen no Ko Tenguri;TeKSMeLater;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TeKSMeLater;7;"Tenguri, the Boy of the Plains could have been just another obscure and forgotten piece of animation from the past...which it kind of is actually, but the value it carries makes this an interesting entry within anime history. It is the result of several intertwining stories, the birth of a culturally and internationally significant studio, and an unbelievable, although indirect, crossover, from two of the most important forces in anime.During the early 70s, the tumultuous state of Toei Animation and its exploitation of animators, alongside the bankruptcy of Mushi Production, have led many to quit the company and make their own animation studios. Among this is one Daikichiro Kusube, who in his second attempt to create an animation studio found Shin-Ei Animation, known today for producing some of Japan’s cultural landmarks in children’s shows, Doraemon and Crayon Shin-chan.Around the same time, Osamu Tezuka, classic workaholic, was approached by a dairy company to write and direct an animated short promoting their product. However, as Tezuka’s interest in anime waned and as he started to focus more on manga, he was unable to provide the company his assistance, leading the company to end up commissioning the newly-formed Shin-Ei Animation to produce the short following Tezuka’s script.The company, frustrated by about two years of Tezuka tippy-toeing around the project, gave the studio an insurmountable one-month deadline to finish the short. As a result, this would only be one of the very few instances a burned out Yasuo Otsuka would ever hold the director role, and on future projects with Studio Ghibli, would only take animation-related positions.For such a short timeframe, however, Tenguri just shows how much talent and craft these animators put into their work. Otsuka’s short is filled with fluidity; just the kind of animation you would nearly expect from a World Masterpiece Theater episode—and the similarities do not stop there. While on the exterior Tenguri has a heavily formulaic premise, taking elements, such as the titular character’s design, after Isao Takahata’s adaptation of Heidi, blended with a blatant advertising message, it is filled to the brim with detail. With the combined efforts of Otsuka, Yoshifumi Kondo, and other in-house A Pro veterans (with the assistance of Hayao Miyazaki in layouts), Tenguri is undoubtedly one of the better shorts that have withstood the test of time. To top it off, the music was composed by Michio Mamiya, notable for his collaborations with Takahata on such projects as Horus, Grave of the Fireflies, and Gauche the Cellist.Tenguri’s obscurity is understandable—coupled with its strong similarities to Heidi, actual releases of the short’s DVD never really made its way to the English-speaking community until the late 2000s, and even then so few historians have made efforts to bring this short into public consciousness. I hope that this review might somewhat aid in the wider knowledge of this short, that carries a much deeper, more interesting story behind its commercial underpinnings.Sources:http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php/a_productionhttp://www.onlineghibli.com/tavern/thread.php?boardid=4&threadid=589&page=1http://ghiblicon.blogspot.com/2007/12/tenguri-boy-of-plains-lost-miyazaki.htmlThe Art of Osamu Tezuka: God of Manga by Helen McCarthy";Recommended

0;Kuiba: Shiwanhuoji;alchemist11;https://myanimelist.net/profile/alchemist11;7;"""Kuiba"" is the first of a *five-part* feature length film series that is about a powerful creature, Kuiba, who is reborn every set number of years to bring about destruction. On one side, we have people and their deities that try to kill him over and over again throughout the years before his incumbent revival, while on Kuiba's side, we have another group of people who worship him like a god, and because Kuiba once saved them, as you will see in the intro of the film. You could almost say, people who are outcasts from normal society are now part of the Kuiba-following clan. In one particular rebirth year, Kuiba narrowly escapes his assassination. As he has not grown to his true self, he appears as a baby boy, who we learn is named Manji. Although it is not mentioned, it appears Manji is raised by a couple that found him. Sadly, due to reasons we don't know, that couple have separated and Manji is primarily raised (now a young child) by his adoptive 'father'. His father's desire is to be a great warrior and passing everything he learns to his son in due time. When news breaks that 'Kuiba' is alive, Manji (not knowing he is Kuiba) and his father try to recruit into the army in order to battle Kuiba. Hereafter, we learn a number of things about Kuiba's past, his power, and the people around him. Although there are Sci-Fi elements, this is a Fantasy anime.The story is actually very much an original and plays to the strength of Chinese history/mythology (Journey to the West). And yes, as you may have guessed it, Kuiba is a Chinese animation. Not Korean as another reviewer pointed out. *Keep note of this piece of information before proceeding to watching the film, especially the ending. The ending sadly is not satisfying because of the heavy build-up in the middle. But considering the fact that the director has purposely chosen to break the film into five-parts, it had to work one way or another and using a cliffhanger would have been displeasing. I actually appreciate what they have done. I would have wanted a bit more, but since I saw the second film days after the first, I am not depreciating the value (rating) of the film due to the ending.The art is heavily inspired from Japanese animation. In an interview, the producers have mentioned that they, Vasoon Animation, are trying to bring quality animations with inspiration from Japanese (particular for Kuiba) and American artistic styles. That said, however, there are inconsistencies in the animation and art throughout this film. Furthermore, the art has a distinctive Chinese feel, which is a good thing. For example, the main character, Manji, is clearly based on the monkey god and heavily inspired by the Journey to the West stories. You could make the argument that Manji looks very similar to Naruto from the Naruto anime, especially because both have whiskers, but considering how much of the story is based on the Journey to the West and/or other Chinese stories, I believe that debate falls short. Other characters also have distinctive feature that differs it from the typical Japanese animated art style. Once again, contrary to the other reviewer, I did not see any similarities between this and Dragonball. The art is very much similar to mainstream (21st century) Japanese anime. Nothing close to the 80s or Tezuka Osamu drawings.There is nothing spectacular about the sound or music, but as this is only the first of five films, we have yet to hear the more emotion-evoking themes. The current music and sound works very well. The voice cast does too. I did not find any particular Chinese voice memorable, but overall the voices of the characters were chosen intelligently. Furthermore, I decided to watch the first film with the Japanese dubs as well. Here, we come to hear a lot of familiar voices. I believe, Manji, is voiced by Takeuchi Junko, known for her role as Naruto from the Naruto anime. However, I could be wrong with this assumption. I wouldn't be surprised if this was true because of how similar Manji and Naruto (original, young lad, pre-Shippuden series) are. The Japanese Manji is quite memorable. Once again, I did not find anything wrong with the choice of the Japanese voice casts either. There was no particular character who had an annoying voice which seems to be apparent in Japanese anime in recent years. The producers opted for a more serious anime with some comedic moments (usually portrayed in the art of the face and mouth).The characters and character developments are fair; nothing unique, exciting or spectacular yet. Manji has not realise what he is. He does not even question why he goes into an uncontrollable, unconscious state. His father doesn't know about this (in the first film) either. I personally believe, Manji will not know until the fourth or fifth film where he has to make a choice that will question his own life and the people around him. I am not sure if it was the translations fault or if it was the directors decision, but we don't know the background of many characters we meet and become acquainted to. Characters that appear many times as flashbacks. Specifically, Manji's adoptive mother and the relationship between her and Manji's adoptive father. Manji's father calls her princess for some reason and that is not explained. This could be the fault of a poor translation, but we later see that she is a very important character in the film. Most likely coming from a noble and wealthy family. The character development of Manji's adoptive father is weak too. There is no clear reason how he came to be what he is and the life he is living nor why he left Manji's adoptive mother. It's almost a cliché story here where the father, perhaps from a poor family, had a relationship with a woman from a noble family, but due to family issues decided to separate while Manji went along with him. This relationship is so weakly executed that during a particular scene when Manji openly calls her 'mother', the surrounding people who know her as a noble doesn't question why he called her mother nor their relationship.Nevertheless, overall, I enjoyed this anime very much. Due to loopholes in the story and some of the character developments, I gave it a par rating of 7 out of 10 (see my profile to understand the rubric of my ratings). If this had been a singular film of 2-hours with a justified ending, I would have easily given it an 8 or 9 out of 10. If you are not used to Chinese voice acting, I would highly suggest the Japanese. It is well worth it. I will not be reviewing the later films, but can tell you that the second film starts straight from the first. More characters are introduced and we get to know people from Kuiba's side of the spectrum (the Kuiba-following clan). If you want to find out what I gave the second film, check out my completed list. I tend to give very fair ratings to anime. I base my ratings predominantly on art style and animation (quality), emotion-evoking music, and enjoyment. Not so much character development or voice casts. However, if there is an annoying voice actor, I tend to avoid the anime altogether. If I review the anime, then I look at character development since most people find that important. Hence, why I did so here.As a recommendation, I would suggest to wait for the English translation to the second film, fan-subs or official Blu-ray (comes with English subs and Japanese dubs), and then watch the first and second together. Watching the first without the second will quench your thirst for more.";Recommended

Not here, the story is just band member hunting to form a band, but its not clear what happened to the original one outside of some shooting.The art is sub-par but the animation is horrible since the majority of it is either still shots or live instruments being played with a filter over it. As for the sound, the music is okay and gives a decent rock and roll feel that is rare in hentai, but the voice acting a sound quality for everything that isn't music is bad and poorly recorded. You can hear static and the echo from the recording room as they speak giving it a very amateur feel.Finally the one thing that really makes this thing a failure for a hentai is the lack of sex or any kind of sexual interaction. There is one poorly done sex scene that lasts maybe a few minutes and that's it. For an episode that runs a bit over 20 minutes, one sex scene that short is unacceptable for a hentai. Especially for a hentai that isn't building anything of interest in the rest of that time.Overall, don't waste your time with this one. No sex, no story, no ""so bad it's funny"" moments, and nothing of interest happening on screen outside of some okay music.";Not Recommended
0;Kinpatsu no Jeanie;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;8;"Some time last year, I decided to hunker down and read the massive novel that is Gone With The Wind, an epic romance taking place during the Civil War and the reconstruction period that followed. To be honest, I'm not a fan of it. If you've read my review, the tl;dr version is that it goes on for way too long, the characters were all either annoying, useless, or outright reprehensible, the plot never seemed to go anywhere, and the authoress really went out of her way to romanticize the South and make the case that slavery of people of color was good for them. Yeah...I think anyone can see how that wouldn't go over well nowadays. But the reason I bring up Gone With The Wind is that I found out that a fansub group I follow randomly subbed an obscure anime from the late 70s called Kinpatsu no Jeanie, which has a similar premise. Being a fan of old anime in the style of the World Masterpiece Theater, I decided to give it a try, as I wanted to scratch that WMT itch I hadn't had in a while. Seriously, I did NOT expect this anime to turn out as amazing as it did! And keep in mind, this anime was made in 1979, when the medium was still fairly young in Japan, and it's amazing to think that even in that time period, the anime industry already managed to churn out its fair share of masterpieces and great stories.Now, for anyone who might get confused by the English title, Jeanie With The Light Brown Hair (Which makes no sense to me because they made Jeanie's hair blonde), this is nothing like the 1992 anime that's basically an animated biopic about Stephen Foster and his wife, Jeanie MacDowell, whom the titular song he wrote is based on. This 1979 anime does use the title for the show, and has a cover of the song used for the opening theme, but other than those two things, this iteration tells an entirely original story out of whole cloth. The story goes as follows: 15-year-old Jeanie Reed lives a nice, happy life with her family in the town of Agatha, Virginia. Five years ago, she met a nice boy, Robert McBee, and the two fell in love. But due to circumstances involving his family, he was forced to move to Pennsylvania. Robert does promise that once his situation is stable, he'll return and they'll get married. Even now, Jeanie still waits patiently for him. There's just one big problem though: The Civil War is afoot, and the two lovers find themselves on opposite sides of it: Jeanie and her family live among Confederates, and Robert is a commanding officer in the Union Army. This in and of itself is bad enough, but to complicate matters further, Jeanie discovers that her family has kept secrets that completely shatter her worldview forever. In light of these revelations, both Jeanie and Robert have to make hard decisions just to be able to survive the Civil War.Seriously, where the hell has this anime been all my life?! This anime seemed to go out of its way to address every single issue I had with Gone With The Wind tenfold. The anime only has 13 episodes, so completing it isn't hard for people who want to watch something short, and Kinpatsu no Jeanie really makes optimal use of its short run time. It leaves no moment wasted, it never drags on for longer than is needed, the story is always moving forward, and it's always developing all of its characters and fleshing them out whenever possible, delivering the perfect combination of drama, humor, and heart. It helps that while the anime is limited by the confines of, well, being made in the 70s, with plenty of animation issues that hold it back, along with overly theatrical acting and sound effects that were common at the time, all of the drama it does manage to show is meaningful and brings out the best in the characters, giving them far more depth and nuance than other stories of this caliber. Continuing onto that, unlike Gone With The Wind, which is very heavily biased towards the South, Kinpatsu no Jeanie makes absolutely no attempt to present one side of the war as being wholly in the right. It shows that both the North and the South make their fair share of bad decisions and do their fair share of bad things while not presenting either side as being outright villainous.On the subject of animation, it's clear that this anime was made in the late seventies, complete with shoujo-esque character designs, limited character motion, rough linework, and painted backgrounds. The animators really tried hard to make this anime look as good as they could, and even with the occasional goofs here and there, it's clear there's a lot of care put into this. But Kinpatsu no Jeanie does have some pretty glaring animation flaws. For one, the backgrounds are beautifully painted, but during scenes where characters are either running or riding horses, when the background is scrolling past them, it often looks like the animators just looped the same backgrounds over and over again while making no attempt to make the transition look seamless, almost like a gif. Plus, there are times when the creators outright spell English words or names wrong. At several points, there are saloon signs that spell Agatha as Agata, and even Jeanie's last name is spelled as Leed instead of Reed, even though the latter is the correct spelling. Other anime did this as well, even the various World Masterpiece Theater anime, but yeah, they could have tried a little harder with that. On the other hand, the soundtrack is very pleasant to listen to and really captures the feel of old timey America, complete wit harmonicas, trumpets, saxophones, banjos, and ukuleles. At one point, the anime uses the instrumentation for Camptown Races during a saloon scene, and the only reason I even know about that song is because I heard it in an episode of Hey Arnold.Returning to the characters, the show makes great use of them even with its short run time. Every character, from Jeanie and her family to even minor characters who only appear in one episode, are all amazingly well developed and fleshed out, given multiple sides to their personalities, and all serve their roles perfectly, with all of them feeling fresh. Jeanie herself is a great main character, who grows as a person throughout the course of the series from a naive, sheltered, lovestruck girl to a brave, open-minded, caring young woman who is much more aware of the things going on around her, but she also has enough flaws and weaknesses to make her feel like a three-dimensional human being. The other characters also get the right amount of time in the limelight, and even the characters who look like they could be villains at first glance are not only surprisingly competent, but are given plenty of depth and nuance so that they feel like regular people just doing their jobs in a bad situation, or feel they've been wrong by the other side, rather than just incompetent villains who are evil just for the sake of it. Take note, Gone With The Wind. Of course, the series makes no attempt to portray Jeanie and her family as being paragons of good, as they don't hide the fact that Jeanie's family does own slaves and make plenty of dubious decisions in the wake of the war, Jeanie included, but given the time period, I think it makes some degree of sense, and I'm glad the creators didn't try to whitewash history or make the main characters pure paragons of goodness. Seriously, the people who wrote the scripts for this series are incredible, as every single episode was solid, engaging, had great build-up, delivered excellent characterization, and a conclusion that was believable, intelligent, and pushed the characters even further in terms of their development, even if it still left some things unresolved.However, as much as I really want to praise this anime to high heaven, and believe me, I really wish I could, this series does have another glaring flaw holding it back, alongside the limited animation. There are times when the anime really wants to make things more convenient for itself in order for the plot to happen, so it often contradicts things it did in previous episodes, forcing the viewers to really stretch their suspension of disbelief. What do I mean? Here's an example: In one episode, Jeanie, a nun named Elizabeth, and a group of orphaned children try to strike out on their own when the war starts getting violent. The journey is shown as being very dangerous, and they almost lose their lives on multiple occasions just getting to a certain location. But after they get to said location, the series just forgets that the first way of getting there was perilous, and the characters always manage to find their way to and from that location no matter what, often within minutes, even though the episode showing how Jeanie and friends got there showed that said location was not easy to access. Secondly, one character is shot and falls down a ravine, only to somehow not only survive, but climb out of said ravine with zero explanation as to how he survived and got out of there. A third example, and I'm going to keep this as spoiler free as I can: Near the end of the series, a character commits suicide by shooting himself in the head with a gun, but he's shown completely unharmed, with no blood or brain matter whatsoever, and there isn't a single mark on him even though he's explicitly confirmed to be dead. For this one though, I can only assume that the creators weren't allowed to show the character with a hole in their head and leaking out blood, since Kinpatsu no Jeanie is considered a children's series, and I heard that graphically depicting suicide in a children's anime is considered taboo in Japan in recent years due to the country's high suicide rates...though how they're allowed to actually show characters outright dying, along with showing small amounts of blood at all, is beyond me. Not that I mind, as I respect Japan for having higher, looser standards for their kid's anime and not being afraid to show frightening content. Oh, and for anyone wondering: There is a person of color who dies for the purpose of advancing a white character's development. So yeah, even back in the seventies, Japan was still far behind in terms of non-racist portrayals of minorities, even though the character of color in question is treated with respect and given a reasonable amount of development, and not a stereotype, but I know plenty of people will still take issue with it in regards to the racial implications. But I'm not the best person to speak about this in detail, as I'm sure there are others who can go into this in more depth than I'm capable of doing.For what this series is though, I can wholeheartedly say that I'm glad I decided to take a chance on this show. I would never have even known of its existence had I not randomly stumbled across Old Castle Fansubs' announcement that they subbed the whole thing, and since before then Kinpatsu no Jeanie had never received any subs ever, I think it's good that it finally got pulled out of obscurity. It's easier to find now if you want to check it out. To me, this is what Gone With The Wind should have been like: a short, moving, romantic epic about flawed but good people just trying to make their way through a terrible time. It's shows like Kinpatsu no Jeanie that remind me that children's anime can be refined and mature, and not just silly entertainment for the sake of it. If you ever want to scratch that historical fiction itch, please give the 1979 Kinpatsu no Jeanie anime a try!";Recommended
0;Ba La La Xiao Mo Xian Zhi: Mofa Hai Ying Bao;cureglitter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cureglitter;8;STORY: 7The story is a bit inconsistent, and not very well paced, but you don't really expect much of either from Chinese magical girls, which are usually aimed at the 6-to-10 crowd.In saying that, they still put a surprising amount of thought into it, with a few twisted characters and unexpected reveals and, in true Balala fashion, do a great job of meshing the fun, single-episode arcs with the overarching semi-serious main plot.It's nowhere near as dark or serious as Precure gets, but given the well-timed comedy moments and genuinely adorable rescues, it really doesn't need to be.CHARACTER: 8As always, I love that Balala has no qualms about ignoring the usual Moe status quo. The lead character is awkward, quiet, grumpy, and prefers to be alone, yet finds herself the leader of two very energetic and naive humans. Those humans, though somewhat trope-y, do evolve and grow with the season, and in turn, help their leader be a bit less uptight!ART: 8Yet again, Balala has upped their quality by miles. Their wand designs and costumes are adorable, their sea creatures look fantastical and cute while still being recognizable (which Precure epically failed at,) and the backgrounds are gorgeous. The intermittent 3d moments are well-timed and used solely on things that ought to be that way.The attack sequences and action scenes are still awkward, but they've never been the focus of Balala, so that's unsurprising.SOUND: 7The music is cute, if generic. I like that they have much lower voices than many Japanese magical girls, but still sound like children. The sound effects are rather limited and do get annoying when repeated too often, but overall suit the show well.OVERALL 7.5This season shows a lot of growth and promise as part of Balala's franchise, and is definitely worth the watch for any fan of lighthearted magical girl series.;Recommended

1;Hanasaka Jijii;assholisms;https://myanimelist.net/profile/assholisms;5;"Brought to life via animation by one of the known fathers of anime, Seitarō Kitayama, Hanasaka Jiijii (or Jiisan depending on where you get your old folk tale fix) is one of the oldest fables of Japanese culture. And is presented this time as a 6-minute short.As most fables go this story has a moral point to make. In this instance, one about the trappings of envy and greed. It's also about a family and their dog, and it goes like this: an old couple finds their dog digging in their backyard and finds gold in the hole. A neighbor saw that happen and asked to borrow the dog to have it dig a hole in his garden, only to find bones in it. Angry, said neighbor killed the dog and told the couple the dog had just dropped dead. The couple grieved the dog and buried it under the fig tree where the gold had been found. In a dream, the dog's master heard the dog ask him to chop down the fig tree and make it into a mortar, and, believing it to be the dog's wish, did what he was asked. The couple put rice into the mortar that turned into gold, the neighbor did the same and turned it into rotten berries. Angered again, the neighbor burned the mortar and returned its ashes to the old couple, that in another dream was told to sprinkle said ashes on cherry trees, that subsequently bloomed as if through magic. The blossoming impressed the local Daimyō who gave the couple many gifts; the neighbor tried to do the same only to have the ashes enter the Daimyō's eyes and as consequence, was thrown into prison.At least that's what the written fable tells because I certainly didn't understand it from the short alone. I'm sure a Japanese person can tell right away what story this animation is telling them and doubly sure they are more invested in it than I am, but I'm not privy to their culture and found it extremely hard to understand.I don't find the story to be told well at all. Perhaps because of the primitive nature of animation at the time, but I had to watch it twice to realize the old man and the neighbor were different characters. From the dream sequence onwards I had not a clue of what was going on, reducing my appreciation of the story.If I were to refer to the tale alone I would give it an 8 but I'm judging the short on its own so I can't in good conscience give it more than a 5 for mediocrity.";Mixed Feelings

Which is watching art films that - in our opinion - don't have a place on MAL.The score I give is usually meaningless, since these films/animation projects are very different in structure to the more conventional anime on the site. Their intent, distribution, origin is also not comparable. In themselves, these films have nothing going for them, only that they're art films for the sake of being an art film. This is why a more objective score is nigh impossible to give.Nothing's stopping me to give impressions though, so here they are.We watched this movie as a part of the ""L'Animation Indépendante Japonaise"" art film compilation which contains 15 films from various directors. This one was the last movie of the compilation. The contrast this movie gave to the rest of the other (usually incomprehensible and some disturbing) pieces is surprising. It is considerably more lighthearted and considering our mental state which we were in after watching most of the films in one sitting, we had the best time with this one.Make no mistake, this is still a ""make of it what you will"" sort of art film and as such is more suited for those who like that sort of thing, but after about 12 of 14 shorts that try to actively make you whince and recoil, this one was certainly fun. The animation and sound are comparable to any other half decent art film. They work, but nothing special.

0;Tie Shan Gongzhu;jonahthefurious;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jonahthefurious;6;After seeing Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarves in 1937, the Wan Brothers in China were inspired to created their own feature-length film in 1941. Princess Iron Fan was the result, China's first feature-length animated film.STORY - 7/10Based off of the Journey to the West from the sixteenth century, it follows the Buddhist priest Tripitaka and his three bodyguards Monkey, Pigsy, and Sandy as they come across a cruel buffalo-headed king who controls a mountain of fire and his wife who has the only item that will allow them to pass - a magic iron fan. Monkey has to defeat the princess in order to quench the flames and save the villagers. All in all, it's a pretty predictable adaptation of Journey to the West, and nothing really stands out as creative.ART - 6/10For 1941, the animation is neither very good or bad. It features a odd mixture of rotoscoped animation (the tracing of live-action footage) and traditional, clunky and stilted animation. The rotoscoping was done to save time and money, and it was actually used to a pretty good effect in the film and the result is very smooth animation. The problem is that it sticks out like a sore thumb every time it's used because it contrasts with the clunky animation everywhere else. The backgrounds are beautiful though, and some of the effects animation with fire and wind is pretty impressive.SOUND - 5/10Pretty standard 40's soundtrack. Nothing spectacular. The voice acting could be better as well, as it's pretty much non-stop yelling. A few songs are thrown in for good measure (probably a result of Snow White's influence on the Wan Brothers) but they're basically just a stop to the story and don't really add much.CHARACTER - 5/10The Monkey King character was actually pretty likeable, despite being slightly predictable. Most of the other characters are pretty one-dimensional, however.ENJOYMENT - 7/10I enjoyed it, but I was watching for the historical aspect, it being China's first animated feature film. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a film on its own, though, as it's not very interesting and hard to watch at some points.;Mixed Feelings

More than anything else, I can see heavy influences of Fleischer in this work, but there are distinctive Chinese aesthetics and stylistic syllogisms in place that give the story its texture and vibrancy.

By displaying so much prowess, it stood the test of time quite effortlessly. The same cannot be said about Wan Brothers' attempt to make animation on pair with Disney's high quality standards.Tie Shan Gongzhu is fluid with passable backgrounds... and as far as presentation goes that is pretty much it. On the negative side however, everything is kinda messed up. The positioning of cels is inconsistent throughout, the lighting is so poorly done it's sometimes impossible to distinguish elements on screen, characters go off-model when they shouldn't, vectors are all over the place making it a lot harder to discern directions, weirdly unseemly angles, numerous glitches, and depth during some scenes is pretty much nonexistent. All that combined is disorienting enough already, but honestly, nothing comes close to how annoyingly loud and erratic the sound recording is. It can deafen you, so beware.I really appreciate the ethos at play here and that various artists struggled through war to realize their artistic vision, but it's undeniably dated, to a degree it is almost an impossible watch. They wanted to make the first full-length Chinese animated movie, and they did just that, in a case I can only call sacrificing quality for historical achievement. With that said, I don't recommend watching it unless you're interested in what it represents rather than what it has to offer.;Not Recommended

You pay something you get a work of art or song or dance in return. However, in this case i got all above although dancing was more symbolic but i want my money back. Not only was this story line very misleading but did not stay true. As far as the ending is concerned it was not surprising but in the worse way possible. The anime was misleading so it would only make sense that you would have a misleading ending to go with it.Art-black and white-color was too bright- images were slightly blurry in some areasSound-character casting i was not appreciated on. They chose the wrong female lead. Her performance reading off the script was fine until they high notes kicked in.- The script itself for the music lyrics was awful. It was nothing more than a constant repetitive relay of on going aspects as the character progressed. In other words for example. ""snapler spent some time pausing and typing this review. Constantly would hit the delete button due to poor wording or other forms of mistakes"". All of which in the quote of mine would be spoken as song. Notice from the example no matter or i should say it would be hard to do that kind of lyric styles in a pleasing song style.Characternot relevant but should have beenEnjoyment: Despite the amount of flaws in this film one must factor in age of production and the tools they had to work with. While the overall performance lacked in luster the idea they were able to properly show what they wanted with moderate job in animation is something worth noting.";Not Recommended
0;Trepanation;LoveLetter100;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LoveLetter100;8;"Trepanation in an ancient ""medical"" procedure involving digging a hole through the skull to the surface of the brain. At the beggining of the music video you can see and hear drilling sound of modern medical equipment.First sound heard afterwards reminds me of clowns at circus. The sound is being accompanied by morphing pictures of animals which all represent different aspects of human nature. Begins with skull of a goat which is Fallen angel Lucifer or Baphomet. Corrupted version of prophet Muhammad. It changes into fish which resides in water (duh). Which also happens to be where life was first developed on this planet. In the depths of the ocean and depths of our consciousness. Fish turns into octopus. This can mean going deeper into the depths and mystery of consciousness. Next is spider. They can represent femininity, corrupted femininity or both good and bad luck. Usually people are afraid of spiders but rarely they actually are dangerous. Spider turns into malicious teeth that eat you awhole. All of these images were surrounded by waving DNA on the sides of the video.Our main blue haired girl opens her eyes and starts singing after a second of silence. At first I was distracted by the animation to focus properly on the singing, but upon hearing the song for like tenth time I can finally appretiate it.Blue haired girl begins singing in a robotic mechanical way talking to what I think is herself about pretty much how there is no more time and she either takes something or lets it go. If she wants to see herself she must make the ""deal"". Afterwards she is surrounded by blue butterflies. She notices them coming from behind her and gets visibly more impatient. Metamorphosis and transformation are what lies behind meaning of butterflies that are flying all around her. While she is trying to catch them, singing continues inside her head.""Tell me how its taste""""The taste of heels""""They coming up again""""I gotta tame them all""She wants to know ""taste"" of either feeling or literal taste of some food. Taste of heels is her desire to be feminine and wear such clothing. To know what it´s like.Trying to catch these feeling and truly understand them.Butterflies turn from time to time to something resembling basic geometrical shapes. She notices and stop herself before catching one. Orange or red butterflies start flying right next to the blue ones. She gets hypnotised by the blue ones and we go inside her again.Same enviroment as before. Girl turns into a deer which can mean messenger. Right after that it´s octopus again meaning we are goin even deeper inside of her consciousness . Now it´s goat´s skull again which splits into two and morphs into butterfly. And butterfly turns into a new red/orange version of our girl.NOW she fits with the orange enviroment like a painting unlike the original girl and all the animals in the middle which were all blue.Singing begins again, this time she sounds lot more softer and human. Like a mother speaking to a toddler. One of her eyes is focused while the other one blends into her face as if it wasn´t even real.""Maybe we´ve been blind""""But the falcon´s eye reftracted the lights""""You find what you wanted ? """"Did you miss what you lost here ? """"Can´t call your name without crying""""I´am wading through this river""""The unclear promise""""And I will believe it again""In the middle of singing we are shown blue haired girl standing right on the opposite side and we realise there are two of them. Blue haired girl attempts to touch her but she holds back. Suprised opens her mouth for a second as if she wanted to sing along. Her eyes turn bright red and she disintegrates. Orange eyes appear on the screen for a second.Blue girl comes back with her mouth closed and singing continues without the orange girl. Singing of her dear pain that can´t go away. It´s like the blames the blue girl for driving her away. One of the lyrics is:""I think I could feel. I would let you stay here.""Enviroment changes behind the blue girl into bright blue as well. She sinks into the deep blue abyss. Only to realise it´s orange at the bottom.Next shot of her is being consumed by orange enviroment laying and floating.Verses repeat but this blue haired girl sings them. Now they´re one.""Maybe we´ve been blind""""But the falcon´s eye reftracted the lights""""You find what you wanted ? """"Did you miss what you lost here ? """"Can´t call your name without crying""""I´am wading through this river""""The unclear promise""""And I will believe it again""Her head splits into many more. They talk to each other through singing. One can´t let the other one go away. She is trying not to blame herself. When she turns into a deer her head explodes. Now she is cow. Symbol for continuance of life. Both hatred and love are same to her. Desperately trying to keep her emotions and attachment to reality she looses herself.Next scene for me represents flow of time and growing desperation and unsatisfaction with herself and her discovery. At some point it feels like she warns herself not to let go.""Maybe we´ve been blind""""But the falcon´s eye reftracted the lights""""You find what you wanted ? """"Did you miss what you lost here ? """"Can´t call your name without crying""""I´am wading through this river""""The unclear promise""""And I will believe it again""Everything is consumed by darkness. She turns back the clock. Fishes and octopuses swim far away. Blue girl is swimming back to the surface and submerges. Even the last butterfly in her subconsciousness fades away.She opens her eyes.And finally catches the butterfly. Smiles. Looks at her hand.And finds nothing.Unlike in the first scene. The colors here are lot brighter and welcoming. Only to turn to what they were at the beggining. Just...a bit blurry. Confused not saddened she looks into the distance as the camera reveals her full body in the real world.Half-human half-machine. Unfinished. Left in what is a desolate place with no conscious lifeform. From the distance she keeps blinking at us like a lost child.During the credits we see the butterfly still residing in the building with the girl.What we have confirmed by the singer that this is a story about half android trying co attain human consciousness.But I also think that she has achieved this very think many times before. Every time she achieves it and becomes one with her consciousness she feels lost and overwhelmed by these emotions in an empty world with no one to explain any of them to her. She tries to keep them but at the end gives up her consciousness and forgets until one day she starts desiring or wondering about it again and comes back to reclaim it in an endless cycle.Was she blind when desiring consciousness or when she was trying to get rid of it.also it sounds nice so listen to it.....now....again";Recommended
0;Yokoo's 3 Animation Films;jadedXotaku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jadedXotaku;7;"These were certainly interesting. I think it's rather easy to throw around words like ""postmodernism"" and ""pop art"" to describe these, and while that wouldn't in anyway be inaccurate, I'm going to refrain from doing so. Nor will I make any failed attempts at dissecting them. Because quite frankly, I'm not entirely sure what I saw. What I will say is Tadanori Yokoo's 3 Animation Films (KISS KISS KISS, Kachi Kachi Yama, and Tokuten Eizou Anthology No. 1) challenge one's perception of what anime is exactly. I say that in so much as most of us have a pretty clear idea of what anime is, and when we hear the word, very particular images come to mind, and I'd be willing to bet those images are nothing like what's on display here. Maybe that has more to do with the fact I've seen very little in the way of avant-garde anime, thus making these surreal exercises in 1960s expressionism quite the experience for me. Definitely intriguing works of art worth seeking out if one is in the mood for something very much outside of what we mostly think of anime as being.";Recommended

A girl named Jasmine gets struck by lightning and wakes up isekai'd to a world of beast men. She immediately gets accidentally engaged to the first person she meets, and it turns out, get this, she's the chosen one.On paper that sounds like a really simple formula for an isekai, but then you remember that this isn't a Japanese show. It's Chinese. Having only watched a couple other Chinese shows before, it's a pretty jarring cultural shift.The show wanders in tone wildly and doesn't stay on one topic for very long. It ends on a cliffhanger so it's obvious this isn't the whole story they were trying to tell. I guess it'll be interesting to see where it goes in the future, but on it's own this series was just... weird. It had a few charming moments, though so 6/10;Mixed Feelings

I was expecting more of comical spin on cigarettes history. However, what i got instead was more gag and hardly anything historical. There are far too many questions that arrived from this skit. Such as what is the relationship between the two main characters? What story did the male have to offer? what was his reasoning for thinking of his comparison in the beginning? All of which makes me think if this was purely meant for cheap laughs or required some in-depth thinking?ArtAnimation/character design surprised me. The cutout animation blend with live action shot worked out wonderfully. Although there was a scene or two that did not make sense. Such as a 2 or so second frame clip of a 'woman' who doesn't appear later on. Also, shortly before her appearance the animation seemed to pause/skip. Similar transition if you recall skips to either records or cds.Overall: Comedy is apparent. While the story is not meant for sustainable plot the whole show is worth a 3 minute watch.

0;Alice in Voodooland;abystoma2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abystoma2;7;Let me state right at the start that I’m not a fan of trap/electro/whatever this genre is currently called. I’m more of a metal guy and yet I’ve enjoyed this short music video.Yes, most of it is thanks to the visuals. I love unusual/experimental animation and visual and this definitely falls under that category. It’s weird, it’s creepy, it’s gory, but in a good way that doesn’t feel like some edgelord cringe. The visuals here are a delight to look at if you’re into stuff like this. In a way the craziness here is a better homage to the original work than some of the other modernized anime adaptations (yes, I’m looking at you Heart no Kuni no Alice and Pandora Hearts).And while the visuals are the main attraction here, the music actually isn’t bad either – it’s strangely catchy and again, I’m saying that as someone who is not exactly fond of this music genre.Overall, I would certainly recommend watching it (well, by the time you’ve finished reading this review you could have already watched it), and ideally without the mindset of “wait, this doesn’t feel like a regular anime, I must downrate it”.;Recommended
0;Milky Passion: Dougenzaka - Ai no Shiro;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;2;"“Milky Passion: Dougenzaka - Ai no Shiro” has one of the dumbest plots I’ve ever seen in an OVA, and that’s saying a lot. There is nothing redeeming about the vapid story — heck, it’s not even “so bad it's good” material — it’s just a lame, nonsensical excuse for a romantic comedy.“Milky Passion” follows Hiromi, a 20-year-old woman working as a stereotypical office lady at a large Japanese company, who is whisked away into a car after work by two suspicious men and taken to a love hotel, where she’s told by the manager there that they want her to become the hotel’s new president. Before she can decline the offer, made to her because her late estranged father was the hotel’s founder (and she was also born in that very hotel, by the way!), she’s given a fancy apartment near the hotel with designer clothes and accessories, which impress all of the people at her workplace, so she agrees to it (and presumably quits her other job). Qualifications? Experience? Who cares about those things when looking for your next president?As president, she doesn’t do much of anything. She tries to at least observe some of the daily activities of her fellow employees at the love hotel — which has an unusually large staff for a love hotel — but the manager, a (naturally) handsome man named Fujiwara, tells her she doesn’t need to do that. So basically she’s just getting pampered and treated like a princess without actually having to work.After a former coworker she had a crush on tries to force himself on her at the same hotel (during which she gets saved by Fujiwara in an incredibly ridiculous way), a foreigner checks into the hotel and intentionally causes a bunch of problems for the staff. Right after he leaves, someone conveniently comes in with a newspaper article stating that that very guy is planning to open the ultimate love hotel in Japan. Will Hiromi and Fujiwara’s hotel survive competition with the foreigner and his fancy, high-tech hotel? And will Hiromi’s romantic feelings towards Fujiwara be reciprocated?This OVA is quite bad all around, and the above synopsis doesn’t even get into the worst parts — like the scene where they treat the idea of being raped as a joke, the part where Hiromi’s coworker tells her she needs to dress prettier, wear makeup and put in effort to become a “full-fledged woman,” and of course the nudity and many sex scenes (mostly still scenes) that come from setting this OVA in a love hotel. I was facepalming and rolling my eyes continuously throughout this OVA due to all of the banal plot developments and dialogue. The characters are so barely there that I wouldn’t even consider them characters; they don’t really have personalities, not even stereotypical ones. The animation and art are both of poor quality, and character designs sometimes go off model. The voice acting is not good, despite the cast being filled with famous voice actors. The ending theme is so bland, you’re likely to forget it as you're listening to it.Overall, this is a terrible OVA with nothing redeemable about it. Avoid.";Not Recommended

0;Animal Dance;Fujaku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fujaku;5;Animal Dance is a weird little five-minute music video. Its premise is that the animation style is that the background only has one color, and strange shadows move across this background, most of the time those shadows representing animals. And that's basically it. There's no plot, just five minutes straight of a weird animation technique. This is fine and all, expect that it gets very repetitive. The song playing in the background is dull and doesn't have much variety. The animation, while being very neat, some frames repeat themselves, something that just can't be done in a piece where the sole point is the animation technique. It gets old very fast. All in all, I give this a 5 out of 10. People who enjoy weird little ambient shorts like this might want to check it out.;Mixed Feelings

For example, repeats, jumps, art smudges and unappealing visuals.If you have ever seen movies like Pulp Fiction staring John Travolta you understand what i am getting at with jumps. For those who haven't jumps are when the movie takes on random sequences. It is different and mysterious but generally confusing.Repeats are loops of previously seen scenes.Art smudges are in relation to grandfather animation where you would see the effects of old projectors as noted by the squiggly like black and white random lines.Unappealing visuals was due to the constant image morphing. Let's face it no matter what you are looking at your brain needs some time to register and process that information before a decision of what it is made. An okay procedure although the morphing art is quite fast doesn't and isn't always quite easily recognizable. Therefore can lead to some minor headaches.Overall: If you want an animation that lacks in story but can easily remind you of the tortures of old animation and psychiatrists ink blots by all means check this out. Personally, i want something more lively.;Not Recommended
0;Ahiru Rikusentai;SionnachD;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SionnachD;7;A cute story from the early years of Japanese animation. The story is simple - a group of ducklings and a group of frogs fight over a couple of eels. There is minimal dialogue and the story should be perfectly understandable to those without any Japanese. It would be unfair to compare the standards of art and music to modern animation, but the art is endearing and the music nostalgic.Viewers should note the 1940 release and watch for parallels between the frogs and the ducklings, and Japan's WW2 involvement. The director - Mitsuyo Seo - primarily made propaganda animations, despite being previously arrested and tortured for his leftist ideals. An interesting glimpse into the origins of anime.;Recommended
1;Ahiru Rikusentai;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;7;"I just want to point out that most of the interpretations above are wildly incorrect given that this was released in 1940 - much before the escalation of the Japanese-American conflict in the Pacific theatre. If anything, this was the period when the Japanese were occupying Manchuria and making deep excursions into the Sino mainland. If anything this conflict is representing the Sino-Japanese wars that were the precursor to Japanese alliance with the axis.1. The frogs begin by bullying the ducks, the frogs live on an island - Japan is considered the Island kingdom while it is China or the Middle Kingdom that was based on land aka Ducks.2. The frogs have a naval ship made of steel - a clear reference to rapid Japanese industrialization and powerful naval dependence as opposed to the almost complete land tactics used by the ducks, aka Chinese.3. The director was known for being an open Socialist. The Chinese socialists were already pushing back against a Japanese incursion at this point and Japanese penetration into the mainland had been paralyzed by the Oil embargo by the Allies (whose colonies were being threatened by Jap navies).4. The message here was probably one of trying to persuade the Japanese people to realize that they have more in common with the Chinese and embrace Socialism when a much bigger threat was looming - The broader Capitalists ""axis"" of colonialism that had exploited countries like them for the previous centuries.It is interesting to see how openly anti-war messaging was smuggled into a film sanctioned by the Japanese ministry of Education, essentially a propaganda arm of a heavily militarized state. A very poignant message film that shows that Japanese sentiments weren't quite as monolithic as stereotypes tend to portray the cultural milieu of the time period.";Recommended

The story centers on the tomb raiding group, specifically Lou ManFeng, the white haired main character. He an a friend are raiding a specific tomb, aiming to obtain the ""tomb clear"" medallion, located in the tomb's deepest parts as proof of successfully reaching the deepest chamber.The plot itself tries to present itself as complex, though it comes off as quite contrived and overly complicated. Since this donghua is an original story (not an adaptation), the story telling is quite weak and they rely on flashback/retcons to cover some unexplainable phenomenon (like how did the MC get that Qilin tattoo(?)). There was also some needless romantic drama in order to redeem some of the ""villains"" so that she would side with the MC's group.When it comes to character design and animation quality, it is not bad. However, since this donghua season was released back in 2016, the ""early days"" of 3D donghua, the animation, especially the action/fights are quite stiff. Also note that this season was also originally released in 720p (you may be able to find 1080p upscaled though).Overall, this donghua tries to build a larger world than needed creating complexity and drama where it is unneeded. It has some weak story telling and plot building. But as a first season, it's not bad and worth the watch, as long as you're not hoping for a deep and meaningful story.";Recommended

These two mice both have there good points and bad points which makes it difficuly for the Elder to choose which one is to become his successor, he sends them on a quest to find and capture the Dragon of Light and so they set out on a journey with a couple of close companions as they face various challenges and new friends along their road.It appears to be set in a fantasy land but being 50 minutes long it never goes into detail about anything, mice and other animals are able to talk but any form of animal playing the antagonizing role is seen more of a beast and never speaks. The majority is set in the forest and our characters come across various obsticles including poisonous berries, an owl and a weasel.It is very much a power of friendship show and goes with the ‘with teamwork anything can be accomplished’ and is the morale of the story.The art is very beutiful, every scene is like a painting, the detail they put in everything espeicially the foliage as it is the main focus and thus we are treated to a richness of greens and browns. The characters being mice are a little caricature to give them personality and distinguished from all other mice and even in the large group everyone is individual and not all exactly drawn alike, they even where hats and do give a Cinderella mice feeling since they live in the attic of a large house.Sound is great and fits well with the shows feeling and setting, background music changes from soft sounds when nothing in particular is happening to a fast paced sharpe tune for fight and chase scenes, each time adding something to that scene. Ending credit song is a lovely song to listen to and ends the show spectalually. Voice actors were great, i think the majority of the main cast were live action actors rather than specifically Anime voice actors but they made each character their own and pulled it off well.Gerald is one of the main rival pair and personality wise is the heroic brave one that boasts his achievments, though he is always willing to help his rival when in trouble. George the other rival mouse is a friendly and kind type who always puts his friends first but during times of need can be brave. Chamberlain, Walter and Marie Lu all add to the cast as companions, chamberlain is the do everything for Gerald, Walter is the fat one and Marie Lu is the ratty snob in which George and Geral fight over. The old man Alex mouse gets them to do a lot of menial tasks such as fetching herbs and grapes but it really sets them up for their teamwork to grow.Art and animation is the biggest draw here, they were able to add it really well making this 50 minutes really enjoyable with a cast of lovable characters and with it having a morale of friendship and teamwork. The only thing missing that would have been nice was a short epilogue but even without it it is still great.;Recommended
0;Bara no Hana to Joe;RavenYami;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RavenYami;7;"Hence there's no review for this short, obscure movie I've decided to write one myself, perhaps this might help other users decide whether or not to watch it themselves.This is a fairly old film from the 70's produced by Sanrio, the same staff responsible for the much more acclaimed Chirin no Suzu , so is Bara no Hana to Joe as good as the aforementioned movie? I would have to answer: close enough.First of all, the duration of Bara no Hana to Joe is less than half of Chirin no Suzu, yet in about 20 minutes, it manages to convey a rather unique and bittersweet tale involving Joe, a dog that falls in love with a rose and his dedication into keeping the delicate flower out of the harm's way.The scenario unfolds in an outlandish manner with playful, colorful imagery and is accompanied by groovy jazz audio.It is animated in a simplistic fashion resembling a cartoon, but has some artsy traits here and there to set it apart; everything seems to be manually painted and is a smooth job at that.There's not much to be said about the characters, aside of Joe who is an endearing little pup that tries his biggie best to protect the rose from any perils, the rose is personified a bit as well , but nothing too distinctive aside of showing gratitude towards Joe.Overall, even if Bara no Hana to Joe doesn't explore themes near as consacrated and jarring as Chirin no Suzu, it still manages to convey a lot of emotion in a lighthearted manner and makes for a nice, quick watch and I consider that it deserves at least a bit more recognition for its authenticity.";Recommended

Yes, you read that right. This is the trippy-dippy Seventies, after all, and why not a kiddie story about love between an animal and a plant? All is well...until the introduction of evil Mr. Crow (cue the overdramatic villain music so you know he's bad). At times their antics devolve into Looney Tunes style chase scenes.

The civilians were too, but since the citizenship, the socialist ideas it became more emphased if the civilians were suffering. I don't have to tell anything really any particular about the World War I, the national independence wars or even about the World War II. There are iconic movies about these, showing us the lifestyle in those days both in good way and bad way.Concerning this in an anime, it becomes more interesting. We have two great titles about the World War II's inhumanity: Hotaru no Haka and Hadashi no Gen. Both are great in story, and in art too but they are just only plainly based on a true story with much screenwriting creativity. The real issue is, we still don't really have any shocking title if it comes to biographic historical anime. They are not just rare, but super rare. One of these titles is Himeyuri.Well, as you can fell, why does the story gets it's 9 point. It's shocking like those two that I mentioned earlier, but also giving us a piece of cake.

The Himeyuri tells the story of it's students and teachers from preparing the island for a siege until the American surveillance, and a bit after the war until the Himeyuri Peace Museum has been built (in 1989). And to be frank, I like narrative documentaries...The art is just fair, deserves 6 points. Mostly it represents how the youth see the world and therefore I told you why did they animated it with still pictures, painted out with crayon. Most people maybe won't like this resolution, but any other else I presume wouldn't look this good and this authentic.The sounds are good. It deserves a 7 for the narrator's voice and her way to tell the story. Sometimes I felt her voice gripping on my neck, when it came to those moments, when you could smell inhumanity in the air. Both from other actions, both from the situations. Other way, there's nothing really much else.Characters. Now they deserve a 6, which is a fair point concerning the fact, this is a documentary. There won't be any development in the characters, they are just there, even the narrator itself. They are just serving their purpose. No names, just relations. It would be a simple 5 points, as an average, but +1 is given for this perfectly solved matter.Enjoyment. Now, those who didn't liked the Hotaru no Haka or the Hadashi no Gen, just stay away away from this too. They won't like this either. The really enjoyment of this concerns those who liked this two titles, and also likes documentary movies, and not even a bit afraid from the unusual art form of this picture drama. I rated this part of it with 10 points.Overall it became 8 points. I think this is one very good short movie about the topic itself. Everybody should now consider: is it really worth to watch this? Well, to be exact: you have nothing to loose. Don't expect fun, don't expect boobs, don't expect guro or anything else, that is really popular and fun. Sometimes learning something is the real fun itself. An experience.";Recommended
0;Kangaroo no Tanjoubi;lethargilistic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lethargilistic;6;Cute short that's extremely influenced by the disney cartoon aesthetic. The first time you see the wolf, you see the Goofy influence in his snout. But, even more than, there is a part where he looks directly into the camera for a close-up and it's essentially identical to the Goofy title card image. The insert cards were written in katakana, like a telegram, which I am not used to reading, so I couldn't follow everything, but the story was pretty simple and I didn't mind. There are adequately cartoony flourishes here and here. From the outside, this doesn't seem to have anything to do with wartime propaganda, so I hope the kids liked it.;Mixed Feelings
0;Kangaroo no Tanjoubi;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;3;This particular animated short was all kinds of disappointing. It felt like a blatant rip off of Disney shorts without an iota of imagination applied. The work is so soulless that they did not even attempt to synchronize a decent voice over. The VA is all over the place, the tone and cadence completely inappropriate for the scene. The characters seem like they've been retraced directly from Goofy. The wolf looked like a Hobo Goofy who'd grown a stubble beard. This is low effort content even for its time. Worth a watch? Not from me. Skip it and you don't lose a dime.

0;Natsufuku no Shoujo-tachi;zaverix;https://myanimelist.net/profile/zaverix;10;This work is an incredible blend of media that uses footage of historical artifacts like journals, letters, clothing, and war footage to tell the stories of a class of young girls who died in the bombings of Hiroshima on August 6th, 1945.The story ebbs and flows with footage of the dead children's surviving family members then to animated scenes based on content found within their journals leading up to the event. You watch as their elderly parents, wrinkled and hobbling cry as they cling to what's left of their torn apart uniforms, talk to them at their graves, and play a song they composed for when they might meet again before knowing of their death. It is truly tragic and such a beautiful way to personify the words on paper and help people understand the depth of loss from Hiroshima. Watching them die on screen broke me in a way I'm not sure how to recover from if I am being honest. They don't make anime like this anime, but I wish that they did.

0;Natsufuku no Shoujo-tachi;getinlosers;https://myanimelist.net/profile/getinlosers;6;Not many people have seen this anime/documentary, and none of them have written a review, so I thought it would be fair to write one.I discovered this just by scrolling through Madhouse's works looking for interesting shows to watch. I found the premise interesting, and since this was made in the 80's and unknown anime like this generally don't come over legally, I pirated it. I apologize for this.To my surprise it ended up being a documentary about young girls who died in a bombing during the second world war. Said documentary had animations mixed in about the girls to make them a bit relatable I guess.The documentary portrayed the tragedy in a respectful manner and showed how it affected the families. You can genuinely see how impactfull this tragedy was to the girls families and the community around them.However the animation and sound direction are what I have negative opinions about. The character animation is awkward and the designs are quite dated. I also have to say that voice acting was also awkward and the quality of the audio was jarring. Perhaps the quality of the audio and voice acting is just a product of the time and it must have seemed decent, but I'll never know.Maybe these negative opinions on the animation and voice acting is because I'm biased towards the more modern side of things. So take that with a grain of salt because I'm not used to the older style of anime.Overall, I'm not quite sure whether to recommend this or not. If you can get past the audio quality and animation quality, this might be an informative and interesting documentary for you. If you cannot get used to it, I wouldn't recommend watching this as the documentary and animation portions are about equal to each other in terms of run length.;Mixed Feelings

So, I suppose that's more than I can say for the director's other films. There's a clear structure to the story and a resolution, but this kind of story has been done, even before it's release in 1965, and has been done much better (notably, by Looney Tunes).Overall, there really isn't much enjoyment to be had by watching this.

1;Tonari no Yarou;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;4;Rate a 4art pieceAudio nor subtitles are used.StoryA quest for end. Or better put a tiresome adventure. While the story lacks in plot thickness the antics used are entertaining to some mild extent. Not only that but it is a story that i think most people can relate to in some matter. As for the conclusion the artist chose the only realistic answer.Art-i understand this is an older production (1960's) but come now. Are you telling me the artist couldn't spice of the scene with more colors? The only colors i can recall were used on hats. Which i think was used to help the viewer identify different characters. Which was a good idea.- For a low budget production which can be seen by the overall background of the piece i did enjoy some artistic choices. Such as the night and day mode. When you think of night you probably see pitch black or close to that. Not here the artist took a more simplistic approach. He focused just highlighting the main character with color or absent of color.- Although, some artist choices were flawed. Such as the door. Upon a close up the art it is clear the door is closed. Later in the film the main character treats the door as if it was open by walking through it.- also the dimensions of the room for some reason seemed off to me.Soundwhile the sound effects did add to the show not all of them were welcomed. For some were either to high in tone or were used for an improper situation.Overall: At the time this was scene as an advancement. Looking at from today it is clearing sub-par in comparison to more modern pieces. Even though it is not modern you can still find some rare(unique) forms of artist expression that you might not find in current films but only in old. Such as the night and day mode i referred to.;Not Recommended
0;Satsujin Kippu wa Heart-iro;yoshihiro56;https://myanimelist.net/profile/yoshihiro56;7;The main girl Nagare is suspended from school and decides to visit Nagasaki and then she gets caught in a murder case. It's a fun little mystery ova and it won't have you scratching your head about who the culprit is. It has it's little twists but nothing crazy. If anything I enjoyed the male main character the most in this show. Your main characters are Nagare Seiko and her cat Gonbei, and a guy named Misora Chuta. Nagare is a strong willed girl who for some reason doesn't like Misora and treats him harshly all the time. She's kind of a tsundere to him in a way. Now Misora is what made me like this ova more. He adds most of the comedy to the show and he never gives up on Nagare and he has an air of mystery to him that makes him a cool character. This ova is dated but it is a good little time killer and it's only 50 minutes. Give it a shot.;Recommended
0;Satsujin Kippu wa Heart-iro;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"“Satsujin Kippu wa Heart-iro” is a 1-episode romance murder mystery OVA, and although there are some good things about it and it’s largely watchable, the story is left incomplete and most aspects of this OVA do not hold up to scrutiny.“Satsujin” is based off of the first of a series of 52 (!) novels by Hiroyasu Yamaura about the main character, Seiko Nagare. She’s a high school student who enjoys going on solo trips, with the goal of looking for love along the way. What she mostly finds, however, is murder.This first installment of the story is no different. While on a train to Nagasaki, she reads a newspaper article about someone who had been murdered the day before, but the problem is that she had just seen him in person on that very train earlier. (Contrary to the current synopsis written on this site, no murders actually take place on the train.) After arriving in Nagasaki, she finds more murdered people, whose untimely demises seem to have something to do with people she met on the train, so she gets involved in trying to solve the murders. Helping her out is a young man named Chuuta, who shows persistent interest in Seiko throughout the entire OVA, despite her refusals of his advances. His doggedness is endearing at first, but later becomes straight-up disturbing and stalker-ish. Chuuta also has a mysterious air around him and seems to be more than what he lets on.Since this just adapts the content of the first novel, the story feels incomplete. We don’t get to find out about Chuuta’s background, for example, and there’s little to no character development. Also, there’s this whole issue with playing cards that does not get explained (the “heart” in the OVA’s title refers to the card suit). In addition, the murder mystery featured here is convoluted. The culprit is pretty obvious from early on, but their motivations are just dumped on the viewer at the end in a confusing monologue. I’m still not exactly sure what the reasoning behind the murders was.The characters are paper-thin at best and annoying at worst. They continuously make dumb decisions and react unrealistically to the events occurring around them. The cat, which is mostly there for comic relief, does not act very feline at all; he obediently stays put in Seiko’s backpack most of the time, and follows her and the others around like a dog for the rest. The dialogue is simple and somewhat condescending at times. How many times do characters have to tell Seiko that it’s dangerous to travel alone as a girl, and that she needs a man with her?All of that being said, I did like the premise and setting of the OVA. A young woman traveling the country by herself on a train is not something you see in anime much, if at all. And it’s refreshing to see some of the famous landmarks and historical sites of Nagasaki.As far as technical aspects go, the animation and direction are quite bad. The animation is noticeably cheap, and the scene transitions are confusingly choppy. The characters look bland. The music is okay, but forgettable. The voice acting is average; the one stand out is Toshihiko Seki as Chuuta, but even there, Chuuta just sounds like every other male character lead that Seki voiced in the ‘80s and ‘90s.There is significant objectionable content in this OVA, despite its PG-13 rating here. There’s a scene with nudity as Seiko takes a bath, dead bodies being hung and crucified, attempted murder, groping and sexist dialogue. Also, the stalker-like behavior of Chuuta may make some uncomfortable.Overall, I did find “Satsujin” to be watchable, but just barely. The subpar technical aspects are distracting, the objectionable content is disturbing, and the murder mystery itself is rather weak. However, it has an interesting premise and is set in Nagasaki, which is a rather unique setting for an anime. If you can stomach the negative aspects, you may find this worth watching.";Mixed Feelings

0;Utsunomiko: Heaven Chapter;sorcery;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sorcery;9;"Among the prolific lineage of Light Novel Adaptations, there is a before and after ""Shakugan no Shana"". This title dramatically modeled the modern scenery of this medium, from 2005 to onwards... But what about its lesser known debuts? The most cultured elements of the community would answer that there is ""Slayers"" in the 90s, but they would be only half right. Although it is true that this light-hearted 'sword and sorcery' is the first of its kind to be popular in the West, a long running Light Novel was already well established in Japan: that, is Utsunomiko.Spanning to 52 volumes under the pen of the honorable Keisuke Fujikawa, his brain child started in 1984, only to be concluded in 1998.A prequel movie (which is still untranslated) premiered in march 1989. Even though it was far to be a smashing hit of ""Delivery Girl Kiki"" scale, it garnered enough success at the box-office to warrant the creation of the present OAV series. The franchise is, at core, a Fantasy Jidaigeki Epic. Themes in relation to piety and chivalry being dear to Fujikawa, his creation sort of comes off as an oriental equivalent of the Arthurian cycle. Replace the Camelot era by the Jinshin-no-Ran civil war of 762, the knights of the round by Shugenja monks, Christianity by Shugendo, the dazzling charger by a celestial boat and you may notice they share like-minded topoi. Furthermore, they both blend a Historical base with a more Fantastic component. The big difference is that Utsunomiko, the main character, is a champion of the people instead of a lord.As its name indicates, Utsunomiko: Heaven Chapter, merely adapts the second arc of the Light Novel. As such, there is this latent impression to jump on it In Media Res, as the intrigue was defined previously. Indeed, upon completion, the spectator is left with many questions on his mind: How the little goddess Kijimuna joined the Shugenja? What were the events driving the prince Kawashima to betray his entourage? Why was Ootsu no Miko executed? What lead the valiant thief Uokai to meet the same fate? Fortunately, the focused storytelling of this OAV series alleviates the confusion. It is largely due to its protagonist, Utsunomiko, who is a proactive leader. There is no beating around the bush, because he is straightforward in what he aims for. Not even the idealistic romance between Utsunomiko and Kagami, which is particularly elevated, is disruptive. It intersects neatly with the plot, rather than shunting it through unnecessary digressions.In essence, U:HC is as anti Isekai as it gets: it starts with the small Terran crew departing to Heaven as fleshly VISITORS. That is all the subtlety, as the main protagonist and his companions are not perceived as chosen ones by their hosts... On the contrary, they are seen as intruders who might be up to no good. Moreover, they initially come to seek enlightenment, not meddle with otherwordly affairs. The ascetic outfits of the monks is indicative of their humility, in contrast with the pomp of the Touriden Gods. The tense conflict between the two parties is emotionally involving, as it stems up from a dramatic double truth.Art Direction has a pivotal importance as its mission is to convince the spectator that the title is not a fraud. Anyone who owned the Laserdisc of the series at the time, was certainly blown away by the gracious ballet of Yukata-clad angels flying in the sky, the frolicking winged horses or the floating lagoons enfolding at screen. The supreme God's castle is itself a imposing structure, harmonizing a rough Chinese style with the exuberance of Art Nouveau. The Chara-design in itself goes for practicality. The distinctive Toei Douga touch, strays somewhat from Mutsumi Inohata's chara-design, who illustrated the source. This matter of fact is further evidenced by the appearance of certain characters; master Ozunu looks like Toki whereas Taishakuten has a vague likeliness with Rei. It would not be surprising if Toei enlisted the help of key animators who worked on ""Hokuto no Ken"". Thankfully, the mecha design of Katsumi Itabashi adds enough of an extra to avoid it looking derivative.As for Saki Makihiro's score, it is captivating. The background musics are solemn, yet are neither ponderous nor stuffy. Synth backs up more traditional instrumentation as they pulse at every turn of phrase with epic breadth. A less vibrant contribution would have undermined the show's atmosphere, but a shortcoming the soundtrack is not... All the Seiyuu provide an inspired performance; Toei went as far as casting the voice of Seiya for Utsunomiko, as to associate in the spectator's mind the mythological backdrop of two different series. Personal favorite being Banjou Ginga as Taishakuten, exuding with godly self confidence as his blaring, deep voice echoes like a war horn.Half extrospective and introspective, half spiritual and grounded, U:HC is a metaphysical Odyssey into Mystery, Enchantment and Danger. Whereas it does not innovate in any way, it extracts a Nekketsu motif and translates it in a near flawless way. It is a most recommended addition, to anyone willing to watch a Fantasy Epic balancing aptly the fun, the tense and the ethereal together. If it were not for the flaws listed on the colophon, this unfairly overlooked entry would have been rewarded with a perfect 10...~Praise be unto Sacred Geometry..| Colophon |..This section is dedicated to content indication in order to inform audience in a practical way. On the next paragraph, the buzzwords offer hints about the title's strong suits and drawbacks.Ketchup meter: Nothing too objectionable. There is no gore or blood shed to be seen. Most of the violence results from Utsunomiko intensely suffering his passion, as he learns to concile his dual nature.xXx meter: What do you think this is? Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai?Fishing scene(s): Oddly enough, in the second episode, it features the only existing instance of a ship hooked and dragged below the sea level. It is a clever way to introduce the heroes to an exiled deity's plea.POSITIVE aspects:+ The timeless fairytale art direction, going for a classicist approach+ The Laserdisc worthy animation+ The stakes being adjusted in consequence, as the protagonist is a demi-god. Is there a more fearsome obstacle than a Supreme God, after all?+ An excellent balance, between the didactic subplot, the romance and the main conflict+ No cringy Isekai tropes to ruin the premise+ The limpid narration, helping to immerse into the big-scaled epicNEGATIVE aspects:- The esoteric Buddhist flavoring, which may deter a casual western spectator.- A regrettably necessary In Media Res start- The concept of physical and spiritual death, not tackled properly- The recurrent tendency to utilize master Ozunu's appearances as an almighty plot device.- The cliffhanger ending making one wish for more (even though the Heaven arc was at least fully finalized)";Recommended

To believe there is racism in the world,surely is an unknown and often ignored element of social life as it is today.There are many different cubes, like the normal ones, the long ones,the green ones, the red ones, the beige ones, and the weird ones.There are also fat ones, that are fat-shamed throughout the whole thing,which is really disturbing and people who witnessed fat-shaming in theirlives could be triggered by it, cause it's all weird and stuff.So go, and experiencing the political, social and satirical horror this monsterouswork is.;Recommended

This is an animation made by Adachi Mitsuru and is a pretty good advertisement in terms of stylistic features. Ratings are biased due to my favouritism towards Adachi Mitsuru's work, however this advertisement is pretty cool. I don't understand why people give low scores to this, as the people that have watched this probably appreciate Adachi's work. Not everything can be an anime, and this was a pretty cool advertisement in terms of both the release of Idol A and giving a morale story.Off-topic because I believe mods won't read this, but lets be real the main character of Idol A, Satomi Azusa, is an exact replica of Katsuki Mizutani. Literally both characters share the same hair shape unlike the short hairs from H2, Cross Game, Nozomi Witches, Slow Step, Miyuki, Hiatari Ryoukou, Mix, Nine, Rough, Slow Step and Natsu no Rakugaki, it is the exact same. Even the eyes are the same colour, blue, which are the only two female characters Adachi has made with blue eyes. I think. It may probably be hard to depict the differences between each character as literally everyone made by Adachi looks the same from other anime/manga, including Touch and many of his other work.";Recommended
0;Ga no Iru Tokoro;WhatDothLife;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WhatDothLife;6;"Ga no Iru Tokoro (A Place Where There Are Moths) is an interesting beast. The story revolves around urbanization and nature, with a middle-aged woman serving as the character we focus on, and her experience with the moths.The art is photo-realistic...what seem to be animated portraits of things such as buildings, a pot, a middle-aged woman. The only exception lies with the moths, which seem unreal, not of the plane the woman exists in. I admire the odd art style and the decision to utilize it.The sound is...fitting, but not without it's faults. The moths often use a small sound that could get irritating very quickly. However, this could be viewed as in line with the story, making it have a greater effect.The characters are interesting, despite the brevity of the animation and the lack of introduction to them. There are only ""two"" characters, being the middle-aged woman and the moths. Evidenced by their environment, there is a clear struggle, a clear frustration between the woman and the moths. Urbanization and Nature are colliding, and it creates characters that seem fleshed out despite not being so at all.Overall, I enjoyed this odd short film. While I am not inherently sure of its meaning, I can say the oddity of it and the surrealism it purveys is worth the watch.7/7/5/7/7/6";Mixed Feelings
0;Shaonian Jinyiwei;rmremail;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rmremail;8;Please note that I will mention spoilers in this review.This story starts with three thieves entering int competition to see who can steal the most precious thing from the city, And the first season plays out as a fairly typical Shonen, as our protagonist gets involved in trying to solve the crime and get revenge for his father.But season two is a complete mess, with new sub plots being added every episode, characters doing things for poorly explained reasons and NOTHING getting resolved.But surprisingly, the show's not all bad. The two main characters are very well written, The male protagonist doesn't follow the typical Shonen tropes of going through a sudden improvement in skill. He starts out as slightly above average, and is all he is. And he doesn't attract the attention of the girl by rescuing her or by his skill, but by being considerate.Overall, the show is watchable, if only for the characters. Sadly, it is probably one of the best Chinese anime currently out there.;Recommended
1;Shaonian Jinyiwei;Adrian_Beltran;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Adrian_Beltran;8;The story is okay and the animation is good ( it’s not a masterpiece but it’s enjoyable). I really enjoy because it’s characters. The two main characters are great because they seem like actual humans because they deal with problems your can related. They chemistry as a couple is really good, they have good moments but also bad moments but they work thru them and they are always there for each other. i specifically like the police officer and female thief because they brought comedy into the show which was great, at the beginning, the female thief felt like she was going to be just another villain but as the story progress, I really enjoy her interactions with the other characters as they had some of the funniest scenes. The show is definitely enjoyable tragically there is only two season, the studio went bankrupt so not hopes for a third season.;Recommended

This combination of vastly different elements was a bold move, but it worked beautifully.The art style in this special edition is simply adorable. The character designs are classic chibi-style and the bright and cheerful color palette used throughout the show gives it a playful and light-hearted feel. The backgrounds are beautifully detailed and provide the perfect setting for the whimsical adventures of the characters. The visual effects are also top-notch, adding an extra layer of excitement to the already entertaining story.I say, more shows should take notes from this and improve their marketing strategies.";Mixed Feelings
0;Wasureta Furi wo Shite;NextUniverse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NextUniverse;7;"No review here as of this upload. So I will be the first to make some informative kind.I won't explain what the narrative is about, the synopsis is there, rather the plus points it brings. I really liked how the execution of ""Pretending to forget"" goes around, it uses a narrator to dialogue the route of the main character You Machida, which I thought was quite clever, in that, I don't know if I am correct in saying this, but it feels like a good way to look at things from within the mind rather than a surface level. Correlates well with the mental illness of depression and what the mind does during that time. It also gave You Machida a good kind of character, which conveyed his dullness lifeless state in this time. I don't think this was melodramatic, or that kind of depression some people like to fake in their teenage years. It felt genuine.Audiovisuals were good too, very good use of basic outlines that just fit with this story, I can't say depression is a simple matter, but the monotonous and lack of excitement here merges well with a plain style. Sometimes it gets a little abstract though, which was good in its own respect of weary feels. The use of layout was interesting too, it was kinda like a manga panel at some parts which fit well with the job of You Machida. The sound was good, not too much to focus on that, I liked it for what it is ""in the moment"". The narrator's lack of expression in voice was clever too, which relates to the lifelessness I explained.I enjoyed this short quite a bit, although I found it hard to understand, it was really something that I found something to like rather than dislike. It is an interesting one for sure. Side note, not too sure if the narrator = You Machida. I couldn't read the credits since they were in Japanese, and no MAL DB info will tell me if the two match. Overall, good 13 mins spent. Nothing I would fuss about.I can't recommend anime <--> manga, but if you want, you can check out ""My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness"", which focuses on the same themes of mental illness.";Recommended

1;Bai Niao Gu;needmorecampari;https://myanimelist.net/profile/needmorecampari;7;This is a sumptuous little film, albeit a bit vague on the story. Magic using characters and creatures meet in a verdant little alcove—but beyond that broad description, I'd have trouble pinning down any other details about the story. Birds, leaves, magic, phantoms, water, wood. The film is maybe more of a poem than anything else.However, because it is short (15 minutes) I think it's worth watching for the backgrounds alone. Gorgeous stuff. Lush and living, I felt like I could reach out and touch the damp leaves and water-logged wooden huts. The simplified style of the characters' design played well against the watercolor-esque world they travelled through.Elegant, enigmatic, and enchanting.;Recommended
0;Bai Niao Gu;NextUniverse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NextUniverse;7;Rating: 7/10—————It's good. Just not for very conventional reasons. Having read through other people's thoughts and feelings on this short, it has become apparent to me that there is obvious room for interpretation of the true intentions of the writers behind the scenes.I wasn't the most focused on this short in all honesty, whilst some of it has to do with my own faults in how I behave, from what I did gather, I do believe that the execution did not live up to a great standard. It's good, but not good enough. Anyway, this whole meandering through the woods and following the birds' stuff seems to be plastered with nothing meaningful behind them other than beautiful images. I suppose beautiful things look nice, but some meaning attached to them would have made for a more pleasant experience. It could just be that I very much had the entire meaning of this short fly well over my head but I doubt it a little on the notion there was no apparent connection between half the small things that go on here aside from the very obvious things like the interactions and the birds changing colours. Something like that.Anyway, the art here is really something else, and if nothing else about this is top tier, then I would say that you should just go have a look at this for the art. Fluid, detailed, good colour compliments and gradients and whatever is needed to make an animation good, because it's all good at the end of the day here. One may even go as far as to see what else Wolf Smoke Studio has to offer after watching this. I suppose shorts like this have the time and efforts that allow them to be so properly produced, but that shouldn't be used to undermine the efforts. It's all gorgeous.Maybe I need to brush up on my media comprehension skills. I was a little mixed on this so I can't say this is entirely worth the watch, but who doesn't like good-looking images? Give it a go and see what conclusion you run into.;Mixed Feelings

They trick and are tricked by the gods. There is some mythology with the gods powers explained but it is all used for humor.If your are a fan of Toshiyuki Morikawa you will appreciate the fact that he does all of the voice work. Morikawa also performs the theme song for the show. This is the only series that I know of that has the same actor for all the characters.According to Morikawa, he thought the producers were kidding at first when they asked him to play all of the roles,but he was happy to throw himself into the performances so that viewers can forget that all of the voices are comingfrom one person and just enjoy the show.;Recommended

The main issue I have with this is how they changed the story. I kow adaptation don't need to stick to the original 1:1. It's just that they completely missed the whole purpose of the story. During her journey Thumbelina is forced by anyone to marry someone and barely escapes. While the prince is the only one who asks her if she wants to marry him and truly consideres her feelings. While in this story... well... They also kind of took the whole point of the prince changing her name out of context. Meeting someone for the first time, asking them for their name and then being like: ""Nah. Let's change it."" Just NO.This whole issue is also why the characters are boring, one-dimensional and quite the opposite of what they are supposed to be.I know you could think that I'm taking this much too serious for sch a light-hearted movie but maybe I do (because Hans Christian Andersen is one of my favoirte writers of all time so I'm very critical over his story adaptations).There's actually one animated version of ""Thumbelina"" which is so lovely.

1;Sekai Meisaku Douwa: Oyayubi Hime;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;4;It seems that during the seventies and eighties, practically every Western fairy tale (particularly those from Hans Cristian Andersen) were ultimately made into an animated movie by the Japanese - and Thumbelina is no exception.A very light and carefree adaptation of the classic tale, this movie is aimed at a very young audience, where there is almost no real conflict and eventually everyone lives happily ever after. The story is a bit rambling, the artwork and artwork are serviceable, about the only thing that is really notable about this production are the Osamu Tezuka character designs.

While the action scenes are slightly interesting that is all you are getting. No outstanding introduction or moral lesson conclusion. You get some action. Then again this is a grandfather anime (starter) so almost anything from that decade is okay for that time period. Not convinced? Allow me to elaborate in more detail but somewhat vague so i don't ruin your viewing experience.Introduction stated the main character's problem as well as stature. Show became slightly interesting when a second character came in. Mostly because of the cute factor. Sadly, that was meant as decoration and not essential to plot. Talk about a missed opportunity. Oh well. While the introduction was informative in some matters like goal but lacked in others like, how did the character get in this position? What is the background of the ship? In other words the show painted things in a general perspective rather than detailed. What is the point of watching something unless you provide unique tailoring features?Conclusion wasn't bad for its loss of details but mainly for its lack of luster or flare. I am not saying a marching band is in order but something memorable. Which is why life lessons in anime are needed. An example of how this anime could have ended in a more positive fashion would be a jail sentence and a revisit to the missed opportunity the main character had with the cute element. Had he taken more consideration in that of others rather than himself he too would reaps in the benefits. While this example i provide is quite different from the original ending at least my ending speaks words rather than simply cutting off.ArtYes, it is black and white but at least there is no pause stills i can recall. Pause stills are where the animation is put on hold so a text message could be read by the viewer. Which covered the entire screen.Also, in terms of detail it wasn't bad. Could have been improved like in 720 or 1080 version but it played in what felt like 360p which wasn't that bad in pixels.SoundA rarity that added wonders to the animation. That being the voice and sound elements. Although, why they felt the need for one person to cover all roles i don't know. Perhaps, it was cheaper? Either way ruins the mood a little.;Mixed Feelings

A demonstration of an ongoing cycle. What the cycle represents was left for interpretation. I could watch it 20 or so times over and still be perplexed on the underlining meaning. Thankfully through some research online i was able to read up on the showing with words from the actual director. The message was don't believe everything you see or hear especially on the t.v. Don't abide to government's orders like a drone.On one hand that makes sense. We as a society have improved vastly in countless areas but in some areas we remain gridlocked. Mainly with the start of creation. We have seemed throughout time to hold that in high regards. What we should be doing is asking ourselves is it really still great? Is there more that we are missing?On the hand the government was designed with our hopes in mind. That is why we have elections. In an effort to prevent any insane person from taking office.

It could've been good, I swear, but they FUCKED it all up. Allow me to explain. Also, I could only find two episodes with English sub and the motherfuckers didn't add an outer text stroke so the white is quite literally unreadable for most of the show. This also means I had to gather the story from my dogshit Japanese and visual and contextual cues.Art: Pretty good, nothing was noticeably bad and H scenes are animated well on top of being uncensored. Female characters were cute so no problems there. Now, lemme tell you why this show is so fucking bad. The H scenes are decently made but they show - no joke - a few seconds before cutting to another scene of other characters speaking for like 30 seconds, switch back for a few seconds to the H scene, and repeat. I simply cannot blow my load as I get blue balled at least 5 times per episode. I had to rewind the same 5 second H scene just to finish because the entire show ends before there's a lengthy H scene. Fine, have dialogue but put the entire H scene in at once you sadistic bastards.Sound: Other than some odd squishing it was good, VA was pretty believable, and moans were fairly tasty.Character: Little bit of development from the main guy but nothing aside from that. More lore about some but fuck all besides that. One of the characters has the tip of his dick lopped off for some reason? So instead he gets off through smell which I don't know what the fuck was happening.Story: Israndia wanted revenge for the King doing something to his Guild as he is an alchemist. He made a half-elf named Aria to seduce the King and take over? Assassination? Who fucking cares. But he eventually develops something sorta like 'love' for her due to her reminding him of a shrine maiden he fucked (he also fucked her life over while he was at it) This leads him not wanting anyone to touch her besides him. He also made this rat motherfucker named Albert who died, he made a new one named Albert also - Albert V2 if you will, and his friend named Nigred who aren't the same color. YET, in multiple scenes of episode 3/4 they're the same color which leads him to getting outted for creating life. The story is so shit they even forgot the color of the rat bastards made out of sticks and yesterday's piss held together through clapping his hands together and slapping the ground. In the end, Aria gets stabbed with a sword (yeah I know) protecting her master and he simply gives up on revenge since the King died earlier anyways. Also the evil King's son got executed and his other son is impotent so the bloodline will die out and revenge is technically(?) carried out either way. Cool, he pursued revenge for months, forced his human doll to carry out sex acts with people she doesn't care about and die, for a revenge he gave up on 10 seconds after she died.Between me and you though, Aria seemed very adamant about fucking as many people as she could 'for her master's sake' *wink wink* ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Thank you for reading,With love,Muffed :3;Not Recommended
0;Doubutsu Mura no Sports Day;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;4;Rate a 4English SubtitlesStoryLives up to its name for it centers itself around sports. Does not deliver any message. Meaning all play no learning. Normally animation designed for all ages should have a learning concept behind it. The ending i can understand it being cut short where it was due to what could have been considered violent back then but could have ended on a stronger note.Art-black and white-focused you in what you needed to see, the middle portion of the screen. If you wanted to take in the background as well you could not for it was not focused/blurry.-animation speed was a little off for certain events like the clapping and one of the monkey's dismount.-did not pay attention to plot's detail. For example the bathing suit was shown to be stuck but vanished later on.SoundThere a few vocal speakers. Some that was said were not very enthusiastic about their position(job).Charactereach were built differently to show i guess the children that one activity might not work for you but that could be because you are not partaking in the right one.EnjoymentThis is one of the reasons why i don't like sports. You see ugly brute nature brought out of individuals for what fame? fortune? At the end some will win and the rest will suffer sometimes badly. Don't believe me give me a brief moment to construct a situation to demonstrate. Say, you entered a contest of sorts where the prize was something you wanted or dreamed of. Regardless of the amount of players i would say it is a safe bet you will try your hardest to win it. The situation could play out in generally four ways: First, you could lose. You wasted your time and maybe some entry fee for nothing (Depressing). Secondly, you lose but lose greatly. You played to hard and broke something. Not only have you lost your win, possible entry fee but now are paying a lot in time and money to recover. Third, you lose but you come close. You would most likely get some fame, a junk prize but you could find yourself focusing hardly on the small slip-ups made rather then the accomplishment of getting to this high point. Lastly, is the win. You defy odds and claim your win. You become happy for some time and then focus on the next goal. All of which would be better off working hard and saving for the thing you wanted like normal. Your boost of joy will stay with you longer and there will be small risk of any negativity.;Not Recommended

0;Jiyi Guanli Ju;NextUniverse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NextUniverse;8;"I believe it was during the Bilibili donghua 2021 (not really sure) lineup was how I found this hidden title. It didn't have the most astounding presentation for a thumbnail back when I saw the PV of it, but I came across a short with quality that doesn't come every so often, and I have to admit, even today, I am invested in seeing the future for this series and where it will go to in the future.False Memory is a short about a boy whose memories are obscured due to creating a BUG man, named Shi Yan, who is basically messing around with his memory. Fang Tang here is basically the boss of the recycling place and Bai Zhong is the intern learning how to do this job.Everything narrative-wise only exists to say a message, since most of the anime revolves around cool fight scenes. That message is something along the lines of fighting for yourself instead of obscuring your reality by removing the unwanted with something more comfortable for you. You see, the kid here lives a terrible life with people bullying him and what have you, but instead of standing up for himself, creating a BUG man was the alt route he took. He ran away from the harsh reality or more fittingly used fake memories to create a false utopia. I suppose the understanding here is that fighting for yourself is the better route to take rather than having everything done for you, considering how his life would have gone well off the rails having stuck to his false hopes. This isn't explicitly stated, however, more of an interpretation I had. I would say that this kid makes for a pretty good character, even in the small amount of time he was present. He had simple distastes, his false memories got the best of him, and he wasn't exactly this overdramatic guy. Whenever he'd get beat, it would just be a case of ""Shi Yan is here to back it"". His reactions to situations are pleasant too and come across as very honest. At the end of things, instead of breaking down, he actually takes a stand against his enemies. I say this is honest because BUG man and BUG source have this connection with one other—said to be through strong emotion, although not something known to be eternally linked. Shi Yan doesn't come across as a rabid beast of a BUG man, but rather someone there for his friend. This kid took Shi Yan's implicit advice once the ending happens (you should just watch it for yourself to understand instead of me saying everything), and it just comes across as something that would make a ton of sense. The kid accepted reality and went out to improve himself, going back on the right lines. It's pretty good stuff honestly for a character like himself.Fang Tang and Bai Zhong don't really have too much meaning to them other than their jobs in this world. As they say ""For us, good or bad, true or false, it is meaningless."" which I am not gonna lie, sounds like pseudo-philosophy considering how their job is literally about recycling memories and BUG man (who cause trouble). Maybe they just don't care about what they do in particular? I honestly don't know.As for the visuals, it is so very good here. The animation was one of the reasons I ended up watching this, but in itself, it is so fluid and the techniques used to emphasise each fight genuinely had an effect on the scenes present. It comes across as an actual intense masterful fight between two combat warriors. Studio Flint Sugar really pulled a crazy one here. Great fight choreography, camera motion, everything, I don't think there was anything flawed about this. The character design is something to speak of too, it is like a sketch with its basic detail but still has all the features required to be able to praise. I am not sure what the technique/style/word for it is, but you should see what I mean upon looking at it yourself. It is simple, but it comes with a lot to offer. There wasn't too much OST here, but all was pretty good from what I remember; it doesn't impact, however, at least, most don't. The only notable thing is the voice acting assuming you aren't too familiar with Chinese donghua. In this short at least, it is pretty good stuff and suffices well enough for everyone. A good job in the audio category.When all is said and done, False Memory is this good idea that potentially has a lot going for itself. Considering how it is going to get a sequel featuring god knows what, I am willing to stay the whole journey to see what more is to come. For the time being it is very good and seems like it may continue in quality as it goes on.";Recommended

The journey is riddled with conflict as Ye Bugui has a powerful spirit/blood which sends demons and martial cultivators his way. While exploring, Ye Bugui also befriends demons as he hears of their past and backgrounds, some even joining his travelling party.Story & Character: 2/10Meteor Magic Sword is a chinese CGI donghua that, from the synposis appears interesting and different from other cultivation wuxia stories. This series tries to implement light hearted comedy, suspenseful emotion-evoking drama, fluid and powerful fighting scenes and a diverse character party all in the span of a 7 hour first season. The show is so hard to follow because the comedy is just Ye Bugui being abused or doing something dumb and hurting himself, the suspense is literally that Ye Bugui's party chases after a mysterious hypnotic witch while also finding themselves in dangerous life or death situations inevitably being saved by plot armor and also running away from enemies that covet Ye Bugui's blood/body for his ancestral powers. All of this is happening while the characters make small talk every 5 seconds to fill the episodes which is just terrible structure for an anime. It doesn't help either that Ye Bugui's personality is the type to think out loud while in the middle of a fight or an important situation - his dialogue drags out any situation he's in making it such a terrible viewing experience.Art & Sound: 4/10The series has subpar art and animation to be released in 2021; In almost all episodes involving an inn/foodstall/shop the same exact owner is running it - I understand that this may be part of the novel which I haven't seen or a budget issue but it's just bad asset management.This series uses some suspenseful rock music as the backing track for fights against demons which is surprising since for the era and theme, you'd usually use some music that suits the time period and trend of music geographically but I guess if the series has terrible story and characters there's no exception to music choice.Enjoyment & Overall: 1/10 & 2/10I visited this anime with an open mind but as soon as I noticed the main character being useless and his objective not being clear within the first 2 hours of the show I knew I wasn't going to enjoy this. No progress toward the narrative was made in 60 episodes and it's probably because the studio followed the novel line for line and adapted every single detail into animation. This is a lazy way to adapt as it adds some details that could be removed to save time, plot consistency and budget but I guess it's not valued since it was blatantly copied.";Not Recommended
0;Sakura;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;7;Cherry blossom: A Spring Fantasy is well ahead of its time in terms of its creative fluidity and artistic merit. Unfortunately, the copy I watched was undone by the poor archival process that ruined a lot of visual details and also muddled parts of the background score.The short is a descriptive pathos from the point of view of two metamorphized butterflies who observe the arrival of spring, the flowering of the ubiquitous cherry blossoms and the human custom of hanami, literally picnicking under this gorgeous atmosphere to welcome the coming of spring with a beautiful seasonal sight.The attention to detail here in the art is stunning and by far is my favorite work from this director. It is easy to see the care and love that went into every frame to make each frame stand out like a painting on it's own merit. In some sense this work could even be considered the progenitor of modern day Iyashikei.;Recommended
0;Shi Ye Miao Yin;AdvonKoulthar;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AdvonKoulthar;6;It looks nice, but before anything else can be considered, it is absolutely crippled by the amateur fansub that makes machine translations look reliable. The story itself has a few gaps and jumps, which can be partially inferred, but in combination with the lacking translation leads to a lot of points just being meh.I appreciated the visuals, but the cadence of characters talking to each other and the timing of reactions and such is offputting.The world itself is quite interesting, a classic case of xianxia/xuanhuan being carried by their setting.Overall, it's decent if you can handle the poor translation, but I don't think I'll be keeping an eye out for any more Exorcist Edward Elric.;Mixed Feelings
0;Turning Mecard;Skyla;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skyla;7;This series certainly has its uniqueness. It's like a mix of Pokémon/Digimon and Yu-Gi-Oh/Wixoss. Cards are used for mechanimals attacks, in battle, and blank cards are used to tame mechanimals.The series is silly and cute at times. For the most part though, episodes tend to follow a pattern. The children talk for awhile and then have a battle. At some point the characters travel to another world, but there's still not a lot of variety in what happens each episode.I like the art, and some characters have neat outfits. There wasn't a lack in the visuals or scenery. They did a good job on the car's movements and their headlights lighting up when speaking. Some of the voices didn't quite sound right for the characters. The music and SFX weren't very memorable.;Mixed Feelings
0;Fushigi na Koala Blinky;WizardJo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WizardJo;9;Fushigi na Koala Blinky, or Noozles, as it was know in the U.S. Is an old anime that aired on Nickelodeon in the 1990's. If you're cynical in anyway, an serious adult, or a heartless, unimaginative fool, you won't like this anime. Noozles is a kids show and if you grew up watching it like I did, you could probably watch it again several times because there's no way any kid out there wouldn't like this. Seriously, it was that frickin entertaining. The story itself is utterly ridiculous which is probably the best thing about the series. The art is good for a kids show, certainly better than children's programming these days. The theme song will be stuck in your head for DAYS. The characters are actually well thought out and interesting, too. If you're looking to get your kids into anime, this is great. It certainly isn't asflashy as some other children's anime these days but smaller children will enjoy it.;Recommended
0;Shounen Ninja Kaze no Fujimaru;LacrimaMosa666;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LacrimaMosa666;8;Year 1963 was completed basically in 100%, next one caused more propbelms tho, animes are rarely available unfortunately, the bigger suprise I had when I found whole Shounen Ninja Kaze no Fujimaru in one place and even found original dvd from some ebay third party seller (I actually hope I'll receive it, quite expensive shit).Well, entrance to 1964 was quite very enjoyable, with great enjoyment and some decent art quality and nice setting. Very well done 65 episodes...STORY: 8Quite strong rating, but well, it's one more of the 'first ever' animes. This time it's ninja shounen subgenre (yer all know Naruto, right?).Story of young ninja Fujimaru on his way to find his family and gaining secred ninja knowledge from an ancient tome is well written, quite reliable and very much enjoyable. The samurai/ninja era japanese setting is great by itself. Everything starts with yourg mc being kidnapped by an eagle and shortly after is resqued by samurai named... Sasuke, yeah, u right. The samurai takes him as his disciple and teaches him... ninjutsu and multiplication technique that allows Fujimaru to create multiple shadows to confuse his enemies... yeah, you're completely right on your thinking now. As the story goees on mc decides to find his lost mother and fins the ancient Ryuen Tome that contains forgotten ninja techniques. His biggest enemy is Japusai, master of fire techniques that's as well after the ancient scroll.Pretty good piece of story and most importantly it's not too long, perfect for the story.ART: 7That's one of the highest ratings in 60s animes I gave so far. There's 2 main reasons why, no.1 - Hayao Miyazaki and Yasuji Mori and no.2 - it's one of the best looking animations from the time and well, many animes from 70s and even 80s were much worse. Toei Animation animators did great job, early Miyazaki is already very focused on the backgrounds while character designs showing his later works. That combined with Moris's maestro works giving true great quality that back in the day would deserve true max score in art quality. Today of course it's nowhere near being even good, however it's much easier to handle than most animest from the 60s. I loved designs, especially of the main characters and great background works are great until this day, especially in remastered version.SOUND: 6Another nice suprise, well recorded seiyuu voices, nice syns and quite easy to understand without much downs at all. Same goes to OST, which was guite enjoyable mix of traditionad japanese music with some epic instrumetalisations, didn't like opening and ending songs tho.Overall as for 60s show it's the first time I was able to understand everything without bigger propblems, record were clear and well preserved. Good job.CHARACTER: 9The strongest part of the show. Main character, Fujimaru, strong and talented ninja with great character develompment and well psychological backstory. Precedessor of all young ninja/samurai mc's. Smart, bit childish, greatly talented, with BIG heart. So far one of my favs in genre. His sensei, Sasuke is your very typical 'sensei' in every way u can think of. Powerful, strong and quiet. With great influence on mc and finally has taken the role not only of his mentor but as well father he never had. Amazingly written character tho. And finally my favourite, the bad bastard Japusai. Imagine your typical mc enemy, add to that tons of great story where u actually starting to understand and like the guy. And don't get me wrong, his motivations are just as evil as they can be, no crybaby backstory, well, his backstory's great tho. And well, he's master of fire (AANG - I KNOW FROM WHERE U TOOK THESE INFLUENCES FINALLY).ENJOYMENT: 8I just loved it, great story, great characters and suprisingly well watchable even today. One of the titles that actually survived the tome without much harm. Even for people that doesn't like old titles this one should be quite enjoyable. Some great ninja shounen, not the best, but definitely over the average and well - influencing af, just watch Naruto again after this show.OVERALL: 8Strong 8, no mistake. Great piece of history again, but this time much better preserved and enjoyable by young people now. Shame it's almost forgotten. Shame and disgrace (64 bloody ratings!), what's even bigger disgrace is it's score, barely reaches 6,0 with incredibly low amount of ratings. Shame on u mal users, shame again.One of the biggest, if not the bigger title for the genre of all time, influential and well, it's the first one after all. Suprisingly well even today. Nothing to be worry about. It's your typical, good shounen at it's finest.I wish that ine day animes like this one will be well recognised and praised by modern society, especially without animes like that your favourite genres could look completely different. One piece of true history and as I can see it's remembered again only by mentioning is terrible articles like 'First Anime Series of Every Genre (Well, 10 of Them Anyway)', the heck. Go for it while it's still available.And lemme go for next 1964 title, see ya'll soon with another review.;Recommended
1;Shounen Ninja Kaze no Fujimaru;Sesshomaru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sesshomaru;7;"少年忍者風のフジ丸 if you like martial art anime and especially the subject of ""ninja"", you should watch this TV series, which is the first to be based on a manga by Shirato, Sanpei. The black and white adaptation by Toei Animation (then Tōei Dōga) can without doubt be called the forefather of today's martial arts anime.Story: simple, classically structured, but the narrative is well done (8/10)The story can be roughly divided into two parts.Episodes 1 to 28 are based on the original work “Kaze no Ishimaru [風の石丸] by Okamoto, Noboru better known by his pen name Shirato, Sanpei. The story takes place in the time of feudal Japan and begins inconspicuously with a young woman who works in the fields. She has left her little son – Fujimaru in a basket in the cool shade of a tree, suddenly a big eagle kidnaps the baby. Fortunately, a ninja master saved the baby and takes him as his disciple. Years later we re-meet Fujimaru, who has grown up and has been accepted into the Ninja clan Fūma. Under the guidance of the ninja master, Fujimaru not only learns how to create large hurricanes to sweep his opponents off his feet, but can also use ninja-magic and become familiar with ninja-weapons, and so become a well-trained ninja. All of these skills are in great demand, as three feudal lords are at war in the country and are fighting for possession of the ""Book of the Smoking Dragon (Ryuen Book)"". The unique scrolls contain the secret of special techniques and Fujimaru wants to protect them from access by the wrong people. But he has not yet been informed of an even more important goal and an even greater desire that will drive him forward.From episode 29 to episode 65 (last episode), Shirato's notation as the original author has disappeared, instead Nashio Kidani and Souji Fukuhara have been named as creators of the series for episodes 29-51 and 52-65. Also the supporting characters Mika and Taro are renamed Midori and Tasuke respectively, while the main character remains unchanged. Fujimaru faces other villains, such as the ninjas from Nanban and the ninja Haguro.Characters: In accordance with the epoch, good character development (7/10)Personally, what I liked about the anime was that the subject of ""ninja"" has been treated seriously. Most ninja anime, such as ""Pyun Pyun Maru"" or ""Ninja Hattori-kun"" are more geared towards comedic entertainment. The cast of Shōnen Ninja Kaze no Fujimaru is well described and its characteristics fit well into feudal Japan, and all characters have an influence on the development of the story. The base and the characters are simple, but very well staged, similar to maybe ""Kazemakase Tsukikage Ran"", but this anime has the theme ""Samurai"" as a base and is rather comedic.Fujimaru:He appears naive at first, but gains strength and foresight under the influence of the other characters. His development as a ninja, which is faced with obstacles and difficult decisions and yet keeps a sincere and good heart, is well portrayed. In addition to his companions, his opponents Japusai, the Iga Ninja and others drive his development and he decides to search for the scrolls himself to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.Sasuke:For me, the most interesting figure in the cast, who is brought into a very difficult conflict by the Fuma clan. He has brought the foundling Fujimaru into the clan and now has the task of killing him. The decision he made and implemented in a fight with Fujimaru is a turning point. On the one hand, Fujimaru gets a new goal based on previously unknown information about its mother, and on the other hand it becomes clear that Sasuke is not just a teacher and friend, but rather behaves like a father.Mika/Midori:One might criticize that she has been simply designed, but it does not do her justice. Her behaviour is in keeping with the spirit of the times and her support is often a great help to Fuji-Maru.Japusai:He is a prime example of an opponent. He doesn't need a reason to be malicious or to do something bad. His goal is simply to rule the world. He does everything necessary to achieve this goal, regardless of losses. He is refreshingly vicious, without shyness or remorse, just plain evil. It's a bit of a shame that he also looks visibly evil. If he were a good looking opponent, he would be the role model for Morow, Hisoka of Hunter x Hunter. But unfortunately no.Visuals: good Art and Animation for the times (7/10)The list of participants of the art and animation department reads like a ""how is how"" of the later very famous animation artists. In the early 1960s, the anime industry was still in its infancy. The animated films were traditionally made with Cel animation, which is a very elaborate process and you also need a lot of experience to avoid colour deviations. For testing purposes, a colour version of the first episode was created, but in the end the series was only broadcast in black and white. The art is good for a TV series from the 60`ies. The life in Japan during the time of the Tokugawa Shogunate is detailed, a lot of attention was paid to historical details, so that the series is overall very realistic. The anime doesn't have the typical bigeye style yet, which goes back to the works of Tezuka, Osamu (e.g. Astro Boy) and will become more and more popular in the following years. But the animal character designs can't keep up with the ""Koneko no Rakugaki"" anime that Mori, Yasuji drew in 1957 in terms of detail and cuteness. On the other hand, one also have to take into account that this is a TV production with 65 episodes, which was usually realized with a lower budget.Surprisingly, the animation is better than expected in many parts. The realized action sequences, which are based on the manga by Shirato, Sanpei, are very good and just as exciting as the manga. Shirato's Manga sets the standard for the unfolding of action scenes. During the fight, shuriken are thrown, manriki chains are used, ninja kamas as well as traditional swords. In addition, until the 28th episode, the final part of the show was a live action mini special ""Shinichi Ninjutsu"", in which Hatsumi, Masaaki explaining Ninjutsu to the audience with Chiyoko Honma as the listener. A nice plus.Sounds: decent BGM, good VA, OP & ED a matter of taste (7/10)The BGM was arranged by Hattori, Kouichi and consists of classic orchestral elements. The music sounds rather typical and is not very noticeable. But I like the fact that the music was not disturbing or exaggerated. It is background music, it should underline certain moments but not be omnipresent so that there is enough space for sound effects and the dubbing. So the music is fine for me.The OP ""Shōnen Ninja Kaze no Fujimaru"" is performed by the Nishi Rokugo Boy's Choir and was initially also used as an ED. The title is basically an advertising element for the sponsor Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals (Astellas Pharma since 2005; Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturer). For this reason, the title of the original work ""Kaze no Ishimaru"" was changed to Fujimaru for the anime and the name of the company was even sung at the very end of the opening theme song, which makes the context clear.The ED ""Tatakau Shōnen Ninja"" was later recorded and has received a total of three modifications, the first version uses the ED video (still picture) from the first half, the song is a chorus, the second version is a moving picture with a chorus and the third version is a new video in the second version and expanded to 2 choruses.Regarding the voice actors, I particularly liked the interpretation of Kato, Midori as the voice of Mika / Midori. Her voice and interpretation of the role matched the figure very well. Overall, I found the synchronization work very good.The series is not easy to get, I know, but it is highly recommended for fans of the genre. A beautiful anime with a balanced mix of genuine historical weaponry, credible martial arts and superhero magic. Moreover, they added a short vignette at the end with explanations of a Ninjutsu Grandmaster as well as live-action footage about the art of Ninjutsu. As far as I'm concerned, a real plus point of the series.As always, thanks for reading and have fun watching.";Recommended
0;Boku no Sensou;Eoussama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eoussama;5;"When it comes to the world of Anime music, there's always a lot of expectations riding on the songs that accompany each series. So when Shinsei Kammattechan's ""Boku no Sensou"" was announced as the opening theme for ""Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season"", fans were beyond excited to hear what this song had in store for us. But unfortunately, it seems that this full version of the song fell flat, failing to live up to the hype that had surrounded it.It's a common misconception that more is always better. But when it comes to music, it's all about how the pieces fit together. And in the case of ""Boku no Sensou"", the longer version just doesn't seem to work. The buildup is slow and lacks any real impact, and the chorus just doesn't hit as hard as it should. It's almost as if the song was meant to be just a minute-long snippet to get fans pumped up, but then they decided to expand it into a full-length song. And what was once an explosive intro, now feels like a damp squib.In a way, it's a shame that ""Boku no Sensou"" turned out this way, because the visuals for the music video were pretty imaginative. But when the visuals are the best part of the song, it just goes to show how much the song itself is lacking. It's a rare occurrence when the full version of an Anime song is worse than the cropped version, but unfortunately that's the case with ""Boku no Sensou"". The song just feels like it's missing something that could have taken it from average to amazing.";Mixed Feelings
0;Good-by Marilyn;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;3;"Overall i was not happy with this flick on several notes(rate score 1-3)Yes, if you watch the video without knowing who they are referring to you will know they are talking about marilyn monroe.

0;Spectral Force Chronicle Divergence;lublei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lublei;7;"Since the only other review of this anime here is a lie, this anime wasn't on youtube but another one called ""Spectral Force"" was at the time of that review, I decided to write this one.From the makers of cult hits such as Mars of Destruction and Hametsu no Mars, I had very high expectations when decided to watch this anime. Unfortunately, this anime was only available in its original Japanese DVD release or a horrid French hardsub. I decided to change that and voila, now everyone can behold this marvelous anime with glorious English subtitles on Youtube or wherever else you get your anime from.However, I must mention that I was a bit disappointed. Though this anime is a cinematic masterpiece it can't hold a candle to the true masterpiece of our generation, Mars of Destruction, and thus it left me a bit disappointed. Random characters keep being introduced constantly and then dying dramatic and truly emotionally touching deaths in about 3 seconds but since there wasn't any classical music or beautifully animated gore and blood it just doesn't hit the same peaks. The anime starts and ends with ~5 minutes of music, of course, there is no animation in the op or the ed but they make up for it by putting multiple songs in both. The few seconds of silence between the music tracts changing is a really great addition.This anime has a diverse cast of characters, both villains and protagonists, and some that blur the line between the two. Though ambiguity in character motivation is mostly because there are more characters in this anime than there are minutes of animation. The fact that the translator clearly doesn't speak Japanese and translated this from the French fansub also makes understanding some parts quite confusing. The French fansub had even more characters, such JAnus, Jannus, Januus, Janius, and Janus, however, the English version condenses all of these characters into a new one called Janus.The animation is stellar, the story doesn't and cannot make sense, and the overload of information keeps you glued to the screen at all times. Though it doesn't reach the heights of Satou, Yoshiteru-Sensei's top work it is still a must-watch. I wish I could have seen it in theaters. It is really a sad thing that anime has gone down the drain and nothing that can even come close to the greatness of this work has been produced since 2005.However, in a world where mars of destruction exist, I can only recommend this great work to people that have already seen it and wish to delve into the origins of the genius known as Satou, Yoshiteru-Sensei. But be sure to temper your expectations a bit or you might be disappointed like me.(In all honesty, this does keep your interest and is quite entertaining as you watch the disaster unfold, but the literal walls of exposition text and lack of any major peaks means this isn't on the level of Mars. I would still recommend it to anyone who enjoys such disasters though. Also maybe playing the game would make this more coherent but I really doubt it.)";Recommended

The animation, the jokes and the music is like any other second season standards. There is one reference to Space Battleship Yamato, which is called Battleship Tomato.

0;Sennin Buraku;LacrimaMosa666;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LacrimaMosa666;9;And another gem from 1963 arrived. And what a great piece was that. Funny, weird, very, very old and overall extremely entertaining in every possible way u can think of.Sennin Buraku is known for being the very fist real ecchi anime of all time, another worthy time gem from 1963. Didn't expect that from this particular title. Sweet mother of God what a fun I had.STORY: 6Well, it's quite simple story. 3 sexy sisters and everything around them - more or less erotic in some archaic sexual ways. Hilarious af, honest and very, very funny. Everything takes place in some chinese village in nowhere. Full of symbolism, Taoism and beliefs but everything sexualised to the maximum level. A lot of nudity and slapstic humour, great gags and good plot, even if it's basically about a married man who's after sex with 3 young sisters. A lot of alchemy and bodychangings tho. Mix-up of everything, but the very first one.ART:I love the art here. Very old-school but greatly detailed, focused on classic art and paintings, caricatural and very refreshing. Weird back then and even weirder today. The character design is truly a masterful work, amount of different characters is gret, every is different and recognisable in full. Everything in old-school black and white. Locations are great, classic and backgrounds detailed, different without copy-paste locations. Truly among the greatest designs back in the day.SOUND: 3Well, no opening no ed, short eps with some music but... well, sound mix is AGAIN terrible, sometimes really bad and awfully recorded. Vioces are barely recognisable, music tho, is quite okay as on the other hand and there's a lot of sexual dancings and shit. Unfortunately whole sound, as usually, lacks in decent quality and good editing. Voice sync is as well far from being perfect. But if u actually used to old animes it's nothing really bad and it's very easy to get used to it.CHARACTER: 7Well, we have our 3 sisters, basically main fuel for the plot, sexualised to the maximum and still... respectful, greatly written with some reliable backstory. We have as well young monk/taoist apprentice that instead of focusing on religion focuses on the sisters, funny fat guy mentioned above and the main taoist elder, another perv that likes to watch girls changing etc etc. Gallery full of typical ecchi characters. A lot of fun apparently, much more that expected.ENJOYMENT: 9I've been laughing most of the screening, like laugh a lot. Funny gags, a lot of sex and nudity, everything mixed in nice mild sauce constantly delivering loads of fun and ecchiness at it's finest. As for 56yo anime amount of joy, fun and enjoyment is stunning not to mention it's archaism is basically one of the strongest parts of the show.OVERALL: 9Yeah, didn't expect that from the show. I knew it's going to be nice and fun, however, didn't expect that much fun. Decent animation along with great, stupid and very 'ecchi' story gives great combination of respect for anime lovers, great humour, amazing setting, some poor sound and above all - good and reliable show. Nothing more to expect from the mother (and father) of all ecchis. And still delivers more that it actually should. Sometimes 'older' means 'better' and in this case it's definitely like that.23 episodes (well, 21 as 2 episodes are lost forever unfortunately) went smooth, fast (max 11-12 minutes each) and very nice. Great amount of respect for the audience, nicely done production that is as well an great piece of animation history delivers until today loads of fun. What more we can wish from precedessors?And bonus, I posted all 21 available episodes on youtube:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv3P-RR1JYD4J-7dg-e7UIcNsSky_3GU3Enjoy!;Recommended
0;Mahou no Rouge Lipstick;Kraanerg;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kraanerg;6;"First, take note this was created by Otsuka Eiji, who also did MPD Psycho. I have no idea how I'd feel about the latter nowadays, since I started reading it around 2007 and when I finished the manga circa 2016, I'd barely remember the previous part; I was much younger so I can't say it was really sick and weird or just edgy. But I liked it at the time and it surely has some weird and psychological stuff.So.. I really never got what's the deal with all this chibi fixation. I hate 99,5% of the chibi related anime stuff I had contact with in my life. It's already a bad point for the anime enjoyment here. But I wouldn't watch a cheap and dusty VHS rip like this looking for something great; in fact, the fun is purely in the opposite.The plot is completely incoherent, as you might expect of a title trying to fit so many random things into a 20 minutes OVA. It's a maho shoujo (it features the most useless sidekick of the genre, by the way) hentai about a little girl who gets a magical lipstick from an intergalactic 'salesman' pig that makes her a few years older to hit on her teenage friend's older boyfriend. You'll find a couple of (laughable) H scenes, some Megazone/Macross kind of mecha action, and a disco scene in which the lighting and colors + low quality made me briefly dizzy. There is some nice cheesy city pop music soundtrack. Gotta love the out of place soundtrack for H scenes in these OVAs - not saying that as the smooth jazz funk and psych rock from italian softcore makes more sense with the film situations. Oh, there are possibilities of the lipstick spell break and she returns to her original child body, so I don't have to tell you of how innapropriate is the ending sex scene.Nonsense facepalm fun.

So, why have them show again and again? It certainly isn't for the comedy for when the punch line comes in it either cuts out to the next feature or makes no sense.I will admit i did have a laugh or two during the space suit scene in the beginning but it wasn't until later i realized that this anime had no shame. Sure, no nudity was shown per-say but the show goes from slightly comical gags to adult jokes as well as poop jokes. I suppose pg-13 it is an okay market for this but personally this isn't good comedy.Iin fact i find it to be rather sh___(okay, i went there but only to show how poorly misguided this film effect is on it's viewers).As for the conclusion there wasn't one. Sure, the film had an ending time but given its relevance to the lack of story the audience would have no idea the show had ended until the credits showed on screen.Maybe if all the short segments weren't that different from each other and somehow blended together aside from category than maybe i would feel differently.;Not Recommended
0;Hoshi no Orpheus;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;4;While I lived through the seventies, I was way too young to truly understand just how trippy and experimental the decade was. But now, you can relive the magic through animation!This is one weird film, a compilation of five different Greek myths from Ovid's Metamorphoses, from the warped minds of Sanrio (who later unleashed the demon that was to become Hello Kitty). None of the characters speak, instead there's an omniscient narrator explaining what is going on, provided by the somewhat-laconic Peter Ustinov. Also, the stories feature a disco-riffic soundtrack ripped from the decade, with songs by Mick Jagger and Joan Baez.Think of it sort of like Sanrio's answer to Disney's Fantasia, with a heavy dose of Heavy Metal mixed in for good measure. Fairly dark and foreboding artwork -- except when it comes to the protagonists of each story, which are played by the Precious Moments Players. Stories include the myths of Actaeon, Orpheus, Envy, Perseus and Phaeton. All nice little tragedies to scare young children with.This really is a weird product of the seventies, and probably only of interest to buffs of the history of animation.;Not Recommended
0;Pika Don;Moudaijoubu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Moudaijoubu;8;"There are very few anime that make an impression in less than 10 minutes. This feeble attempt at showing the events of Hiroshima's devastation at the end of World War Two, however, managed to do just that.The story is simple, and clear. There is happiness, and life. Then confusion. Then death.Made in the 1970's, the art is even simpler than the story, but manages to capture the everyday world of Hiroshima in 1945 well enough in only 9 minutes. In fact, there is a ghostly beauty to the children playing, the soldiers going to work, and young girls going to school. The whole city is bathed in a sort of cream and pink light. But when ""pikadon"" (the early japanese word for the bomb meaning ""flash"" and ""boom"") finally falls three fourths of the way into the anime, the art takes a rather drastic direction. The colors change from pink and cream to black and red, as the short film portrays the burning, melting people of Hiroshima. Believe me, although simple in art, the images are enough to disturb. This short film pictures civilians with no skin, skeletons clothed in ash, and flesh dangling off arms like rags. But perhaps the most disturbing aspect is knowing every bit of it is true.The sound was beautiful, a soft piano piece playing in the background most of the time. When the piano wasn't playing it was silent, with the growl of the explosion.The characters, as many as there were, were barely explored, but somehow, the viewer felt an instant connection to the little boy with the paper plane. Watching him experience the bomb was unforgettable. The knowledge that his existence was wiped away in only a fraction of a second was a heavy weight.The film, on a whole, was entirely haunting. Though made for children, it disturbed me. It was absolutely something I will never forget.";Recommended

The other quarter is Japanese people melting and fusing into skinless, lifeless, monstrous creatures.Pica-don attempts to describe the indescribable shock and horror the atomic bomb brought to Japan. It is a worthy attempt, with a style that begins as smoothly and cleanly as a propaganda film then melts into surrealism. It's not the best of the Hiroshima anime memoirs out today - with seven minutes and no dialogue, it's difficult to portray any real emotion - but it's the first. And because it manages to be so hard to watch, it's a definite must-see.;Recommended
0;Jewelpet: Attack Chance!?;Fircoal;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fircoal;7;And so with a whisper, the long history of Jewelpet comes to an end. After a year and a half without updates it looks like this venture is dead, or at least MAL says so. Sadly I can't find any data that backs this up so as long as MAL treats it has such so will I.Let's be clear, while all of the seasons of Jewelpet are standalone, including this one, this is not a show for those outside of the fandom to watch. Don't start here. There are seven seasons that all tell a complete story. Some of those seasons being my absolute favorites in all of anime.As for this, well there isn't much to write about it. It's a flash cartoon. It has all of the problems that are to be expected of flash, and unlike a show like MLP: FiM there aren't animators behind it that are trying their hardest to make it look as best as it can.But honestly, it doesn't matter. This show isn't for anyone to pick up and watch along. This show exists for one reason and one reason only. To give Jewelpet fans a little show while they start to focus their effort onto their new toy line Rilu Rilu Fairlu. And for that, it works. It's silly just like Jewelpet is, and some of the fan favorite characters get to have a decent amount of screentime. The characters are of course in general around what they were before and are very endearing like they always have been. Of course, there's no real story here, it's just all comedic bits pretty much.So if you like Jewelpet and want to see a little bit more of it I'd suggest this, it's pretty fun for those of us who like it. And if you haven't, go watch one of the other seasons they're great. As for me I'll have fond memories of the 12 minutes that this show was. It may not have been great but it made me happy. And that's all it ever needed to do.;Recommended
0;Taiyou no Hou: El Cantare e no Michi;MakingAList;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MakingAList;7;"I would not describe The Laws of The Sun as a conventionally good movie. It's more of, so bad, it's good. If you are looking for a confusing, funny experience or a movie to watch while high with your friends, this is it.It's a movie made by the Happy Science cult, and I believe it goes over their beliefs, creation story, and chronology. It's kinda like if Christians made ""Bible: The Movie."" If the Bible had aliens and lizard people. Yes, that's right. Aliens, ancient space gods, lizard people, Satan, and the ultimate god (El Cantare, voiced by freaking Takehito Koyasu) reincarnating as notable figures throughout history (some fictional some real), all play a significant part in this religion's beliefs.The story will not make much sense to the average person, but I was enthralled throughout the movie wondering what sort of bat**** crazy thing would happen next. I was constantly confused. This movie left me mentally exhausted. However my enjoyment was high.The art was surprisingly good. I was actually impressed by the effects in multiple parts throughout the movie.Sound is fine, some good, fitting music, and the amazing voice talents of Takehito Koyasu. I don't know how they got him to do this film.Characters are nothing special, you follow a small group of El Cantare's followers that keep reincarnating and El Cantare himself for most of the film. This is when the events aren't being narrated for you by El Cantare.Would not recommend if you are looking for a logical, story driven movie with good characters.

0;Karuizawa Syndrome;Xionea;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Xionea;6;So just a warning in advance, there are technically 3 versions of this OVA:1. A version with a mix of anime and a little bit of live action, released on VHS and LD2. A version with all anime, live action bits replaced with proper animated scenes, also released on VHS3. A version with all anime, but the live action bits are cut out, released on DVDOdds are, you will be watching the 3rd version, as that is the DVD release and currently the only one available with subs. Now you may wonder how much content you'll be missing out on. The answer is not much, maybe like 3 or 4 minutes worth of content, as the content is mostly just mild sex scenes. However, you might notice a jump from one scene to the next, or a character will talk about something that happened in a cut scene, and that can get a bit annoying. Luckily, the full version (version 2) isn't hard to find if you want to see those cut scenes. Now for the review.The main character is Kouhei, a carefree playboy nude photographer looking to make it big, leaving his life behind and travelling to Karuizawa to live with his childhood friend Kaoru. He also ends up meeting with Noriko (or Non, as she's sometimes called), who is a former leader of a biker gang. These two women will be the catalysts that can hopefully help turn the playboy into a man.The artsyles is very 80s, but also offers a unique take by changing the artstyle throughout the series, such as the traditional anime artstyle or a sketchy artstyle. The characters themselves will also regularly switch from chibi and non-chibi versions of themselves too, usually for the comedic or lighthearted moments. It can be a little jarring sometimes, though.The characters, especially Kohei, are gonna be hit or miss for most people. Kohei is depicted as this playboy who wants to get into the pants of every girl he sees, usually being very smooth about it, and much to the despair of his friend Sumio as he can't keep a girl's attention for even an hour before Kohei sweeps the girl off her feet. He has a dream of living as a drifter in the US, and that drifter lifestyle in him makes him want to run away from the challenges in his life and remain carefree. He's admittedly a tough character to like, but that doesn't mean he's a bad character.Kaoru and Noriko are the other two main characters, each being the women Kohei especially becomes fond of. These two have their own difficult challenges and hardships they need to overcome with the help of Kohei, and I think their challenges are tackled and discussed pretty well.Overall, it's a decent watch clocking at a little over an hour. The plot has its ups-and-downs and the characters are in that weird middle ground of likable and unlikable. The artsyle is interesting and is nice if you're looking for something a little different.;Mixed Feelings
0;Jam;abystoma2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abystoma2;6;Jam isn’t a music video, it‘s a short movie with no dialogue. Jam isn’t a story focused movie, it’s an experimental piece of art that’s fully about the aesthetics.If you’re a fan of animation, and I mean literally the animation itself, you will likely enjoy this piece. It’s colourful, lively and there’s plenty going on. The work with shapes is nicely done, as usual for Mirai Mizue’s work.Jam does good what it sets out to be – an interesting short bit of moving scenery. It would be unfair to rate it low just because it doesn’t have a story – it was never supposed to have one.If you’re a bit confused by this kind of content, I would suggest watching a bunch of short experimental anime to get more context for rating them, and surely you are likely to find out that some, like this one, are enjoyable just for their “vibes”, as the kids say.

0;Jam;IzzyMarrie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IzzyMarrie;6;"Well, that was an experience! ""Jam"" is definitely not going to be for everyone, but it was a fun watch for me. What I like about it is just the sheer absurdity of how much chaotic ""noise"" can be created both figuratively and literally. New monsters appear with the old when a new sound is added, and it gets messy QUICK, which is the point. However, it's also not much beyond a novelty.Because of its simple premise, it's an experimental art piece (with sound that is fairly grating to listen to). If you can tolerate the sound (or if you happen to enjoy it), the overall video isn't long, so it didn't feel like it overstayed its welcome. I have mixed feelings on recommending this, but it was a neat experience all the same. I have a respect for the technical side of making something like this, chaotic to look at and yet each monster still moves seamlessly across the screen. It also has a pretty fun ending that got a smile out of me.Overall, I don't know how many people would truly rate this higher than 6 (and that's me being very generous). But if you have a few minutes to spare and like the description on MAL, I'd say give it a shot! It's definitely a work of art.";Mixed Feelings
0;Datenshi-tachi no Kyouen;cabochon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cabochon;2;"I won't pull any punches; Datenshi-tachi no Kyouen, AKA ""Feast of the Fallen Angels"", is legitimately the worst anime I've ever seen.A friend put this OVA on one night because we thought it was going to be hilarious 80s cheese, and the art style certainly looks the part, but it's not worth it. Every second of it is full of gloom and despair. Not in a good Oyasumi Punpun way, but in a way that makes you deeply uncomfortable and filthy...even moreso when you consider this is supposed to be an ero-anime. You'll find yourself watching Datenshi-tachi's enema scene, wincing at how hard the voice actors scream over the horrible discordant synth background music, and remember, ""Oh right, this is supposed to be sexy.""This was released by Orange Video House. You might remember OVH as the distributor of the Guinea Pig films...yes, *those* Guinea Pig films. One of the most famous shots from Datenshi-tachi is of Megumi - the blonde child on the VHS cover - having her eyes held open by the fingers of the Ugly Bastard (also seen on the VHS cover) while something explicit happens in front of her. OVH was proud enough of this shot to feature it on the sides of the VHS packaging and in promotional material.The best way I can describe Datenshi-tachi is that it feels like a creepypasta. It feels like something I'd find on a beat-up DVD-R at the side of the road. I can't stop you from watching this if you really want to, but just be advised that it's a deeply uncomfortable ride and you're likely to hate it.";Not Recommended
1;Datenshi-tachi no Kyouen;KyleKatarn1980;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KyleKatarn1980;1;This has got to be the most sickening, awful, and fucked-up 80s hentai I have ever seen. For one thing, it's basically a hentai produced from 1985. But from the looks of the artstyle to the characters and background makes it more like it was created from the 70s.Everything is entirely low budget which includes some repeated sex shots and some disturbing graphic bloody violent scenes, you know this isn't any normal hentai you'd watch. And the music in this one is so dark and depressing, doesn't even sound like a sex anime.It starts out with a shot of the city which then cuts to some woman getting blowed by one of the yakuza thugs. We then cut to a scene where the main blond character from the front of the VHS cover, Megumi, who is picking out a flower from a plant. Later on her family gets bondaged as the Ugly Bastard is forcing Megumi to watch with her very own eyes. We later see a part where the Ugly Bastard is forcing in a sex on Megumi but somehow things go a lot more graphic when she bites his dick off leaving blood gushing everywhere and to finish things off leans an angel statue over on the Ugly Bastard's head and crushing it, leaving his eyeballs popped out. She then uses the shower to wash herself off and then somehow grabs a pocket knife and slashes a thug's fingers off, leaving his corpse bloodied in the bath tub. And then it ends with Megumi spilling gasoline cans where the thugs are at, but one thing she probably didn't know is that her family are still tied in that room, or she may not care for them at all. She then lights a match then sets the building on fire, burning the thugs including her family. And finally she walks outside when snow falls, we then get a shot of the doll she's holding bleeding from the skirt section as blood drips onto the snowy ground.I'm just so traumatized that this horrible garbage of an hentai exist that it shouldn't be made at all. Watching this now is just not even worth your time, I'd say avoid this one permanently.;Not Recommended

Since they're targeting children the story is pretty simple, funny, there's not much conflict happening. There's Birthday episodes, and Halloween, and Christmas. There's not much happening in the story itself and very little character development, but I enjoyed it very much because of the cuteness of Hello Kitty, Pompompurin, My Melody, Cinnamoroll, and Bad Badtz-Maru!;Recommended
1;Hello Kitty no Stump Village;VickyOB_83;https://myanimelist.net/profile/VickyOB_83;8;Watched this when I was 7. Didn't even know it was considered an anime 'til today. I remember loving this show as a kid. It was my favorite. It doesn't have AMAZING story or character development (it is a kid's show), but it's still very adorable. If you know any kids, they will love it. As for you, It's a cute show to watch either in the background or when you're bored. If you love Hello Kitty and her friends, you'll love this show.The animation is great. Very well done and just ads to the cuteness and enjoyment. It's stop motion and it's so well done. The music and soundtrack is also pretty good. The theme is cute and catchy!The characters have some character arc. They learn simple, yet important lessons.Honestly, I love it. Imma watch it again. It gives me so much nostalgia.;Recommended

The Chohjotai captures nicely all the things great of the era.This is a one shot OVA based on a novel. I've never read the novel, but was pretty happy with the pacing of the story. I felt like no part was dragged out and we got a nice development the characters without a giant exposition.The art felt fairly consistent (I'd hope so for a one shot). But I noticed that the background animation and action shots did NOT use a terrible lines-moving behind the characters. While there weren't a ton of details in the backgrounds, it never felt terrible. The action sequences and ESPER power usage was animated well. The art of the characters had nice soft lines and edges, but I suppose that could be a personal preference.I'll admit that for the sound, I might have been generous. But the few sound effects for psychic screaming and ""Spirit Gun"" were good. Mostly I enjoyed the insert song at a cafe and the end credit song.The 3 main characters were well written. This is impressive as writing for women characters was not always strong in 1991. But in 45 minutes, I had a nice understanding of the characters wants and personality without it being giants tropes.I watched this with 2 friends and we all enjoyed it. We laughed at intended times, enjoyed guessing character motivations and where the story was going.I think if you enjoyed the earlier spirit detective arc of Yu Yu Hakusho, you'll enjoy this.

0;Jubilee;Stephen2D;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stephen2D;6;"Starting in the same manner like the Italian movie ""La Dolce Vita"" (in this case with a representation of God flown by three helicopters), ""Jubilee "" is like the title says, a party showing the life under the threads of time.Practically, in under 5 minutes, we are shown in a surreal manner a bunch of characters, from the ""mechanic boy"" who needs a clear objective in life or a bureaucratic mosquito who steps on other people things to a fish-woman with two many fish-masks and a salaryman who reminds us of ""Mt. Head"" character design. These characters interact with ease, one loves another and sometimes one gets pissed off of another, but these things are trivial in the scheme of time, so they pass naturally like in the real world.The anime music video doesn't have a bigger message apart from the acceptance with ease of world interaction which is itself subjugated, like all things, by Chronos, the god of time. One can get stuck in it or one can see the bigger picture and be at peace with oneself. The music composed by Kazuyoshi Nakamura really helps emphasize that feeling. For some, it reminds of the early 2000's Beck. And if you're having a good time wouldn't you, like the poet, feel:""When I say to the Moment flying;'Linger a while -- thou art so fair!Then bind me in thy bonds undying,And my final ruin I will bear!""

You have one line of text in the beginning, you have your music song that is it. The first line of text could have been the title in Japanese format. Ergo, not likely relevant to plot. A song as the plot? hmm... that can't work. For artists have multiple sources for inspiration to say one thing along led them alone to their song is a lie. In other words i have stated songs come from multiple pathways per-say. To figure out which path taken would be art and mostly would rely on the art.Art:I just mentioned how the plot was poor and needed art for guidance. Alas, the art did not help. Art focuses on multiple people. Each path they take, along with their actions. Whether it was going high and higher or far and farther. Also, the art was not detailed. For example if you picture a helicopter in your head you would see the lights, door, door crease, joystick, blades, yada yada. You would not see just a blurry version of the outer shell unless you were looking at it from it far away. But the art showed it close up. Overall, on a positive note it was nice to see that all the pictures used were a part of the big picture.

0;Aoi Taiken;MyPervList;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MyPervList;2;First episode is about Miki who starts tutoring as a part time job. Pervy stuff ensues in this house, not all of it between her and the kid she's supposed to tutor. The next episode is about three girls and one older man going lodging into the woods. All in all, there's not a lot of substance in the stories.Comparing to another hentai released in 1984, Lolita Anime, I preferred the characters in the first episode of Aoi Taiken because they appeared/were older. Otherwise the characterization is pretty shallow.You could argue that since it's hentai it doesn't matter if the story or characters pose a lot of depth, and you'd be damn right about that.But this anime is ancient. It's not going to provide a satisfactory wank either. So by modern standards it would fail in the only job it sets out to do. Or at least it'll make the whole experience terrible. I could maybe see someone beating it to this in the 80s... if live action porn wasn't a thing.The best reason to watch Aoi Taiken is to gain a little bit of perspective how far eroanime has come.It's also quite fascinating to find out that those bizarre x-ray shots have been used since the dawn of this medium.;Not Recommended
0;Tottoko Hamtarou: Anime Dechu!;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;7;Question: does anyone here remember Hamtaro? Because I do! Alongside Pokemon, Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and many other shows, Hamtaro was one of my favorite shows to watch when I was a kid. I would always try to watch it whenever it was on. However, when new seasons started coming out, practically every day, I found myself missing a bunch of episodes because at one point in fourth grade, my parents signed me up for some after school program that required me to stay there until four. I can't remember why, but I remember being really pissed about it. Then, Hamtaro wound up getting pulled from Cartoon Network completely, and I thought I had lost my chance to watch all the episodes I had missed. Thankfully, others saved those episodes on various sites, I just haven't gotten around to actually watching it yet. I really ought to though. I later found out that Hamtaro ran for a total of 296 episodes, with only 104 getting dubbed into English and airing in America, so we never got the last half of the series. As of now, Hamtaro still hasn't gotten a complete home video release save for a few scattered DVDs containing some episodes. However, Hamtaro was one of the first anime that exposed me to the concept of anime as a whole, whether it was discovering its Japanese theme song completely by accident, or learning that the Hamtaro movies were never dubbed and released over here for whatever reason.But what some of you may not know is that before the TV series came about, there was actually an obscure OVA that was released on VHS in 1999, titled Tottoko Hamtaro Anime Dechu!. It was advertised in a magazine, but the VHS itself wound up not being made publicly available for some reason, only being sold to members of the production team at Shogakukan, the company that created Hamtaro. Because of this, records of the OVA's overall existence was considered extremely rare, almost considered lost media. Then, on July 17th, 2017, a video tape appeared on a Japanese auction site and was bought by the admin who created the famous Hamtaro fan site, Ham-Ham Paradise. The admin, along with some other members of the site, got together to digitize it, fansub it into English, and put it up on YouTube for all to see, saving it from eternal obscurity! So what exactly is this OVA, anyway?Well, for one, it's nothing like the TV show. Instead of being owned by a 5th grade girl named Laura, for those who have seen the Cartoon Network airings, this version of Hamtaro is taken care of by a possibly 2nd/3rd grade girl named Natsumi. The OVA mainly consists of short, five to eight minute vignettes featuring Hamtaro doing various things, like finding new places to hide or getting into adventures with the Ham-Hams. Oddly enough, Hamtaro is never shown talking, but his thoughts are fully voiced. None of the other Ham-Hams talk or have any spoken dialogue, leaving the animation to tell the story. Plus, for those who have seen the TV show, you'll notice a lot of things are different. Boss and Stan aren't present, Maxwell wears a blue suit, Penelope, whose Japanese name is Chibimaru, is a boy in this rather than a girl, Howdy's apron is blue instead of red, Snoozer actually does something beyond just sleep and give philosophical ramblings in his sleep, the Ham-Hams have a dog friend who goes unnamed (Not Brandy, who is called Wanta in this and is pure white instead of having brown and white fur), and whenever Hamtaro hangs with the Ham-Hams, he wears a red shirt, even though in the scenes where he's at home with Natsumi, he doesn't wear a shirt. Plus, Hamtaro is much more mischievous and more of a sassy gremlin than he is in the show.In all honesty, there isn't really anything special about this OVA, other than laying the groundwork for the TV show to come later. The animation is nice by late 90s standards, if a bit simplified, though for some reason, the animators didn't want to animate Natsumi's mouth moving to match her dialogue. That felt rather jarring to me. But again, this isn't the show. There's lots of still frames, a lot of time is spent on Hamtaro messing around, the backgrounds are blurry and brightly colored, and everyone's fur and color schemes are rather muted compared to the TV show. I can probably chalk this up to the video quality coming from an old VHS tape and it never having gotten a cleaner, more modern release on DVD or Blu-Ray. In contrast, the music is surprisingly loud. Definitely not bad, but the soundtrack makes use of a lot of loud trumpets and acoustic guitars. Then again, considering most of the characters don't talk, it's just easier to notice in this case.You won't find an overarching or compelling storyline here for sure. This OVA just consists of Hamtaro getting into mischief and hanging out with the Ham-Hams a couple of times. Mostly harmless fun you can use to have your toddler sit in front of the TV for half an hour. Another thing you'll notice that in this anime, Hamtaro is played by a different voice actress, Naomi Nagasawa, rather than the lady who would voice him in the TV show, Kurumi Mamiya. There's no English dub for this, only the Japanese audio. However...I'm not gonna lie, Nagasawa was terribly miscast as Hamtaro, mainly because she always sounds like she can't be bothered to make Hamtaro emote, like she's reading off a script than actually acting. She always keeps the exact same dull, deadpan, can't-be-bothered tone and cadence throughout the entire OVA. This is especially egregious because near the end of the OVA, there are scenes where Hamtaro gets visibly angry and emotional, but Nagasawa absolutely refuses to raise her voice or put any emotion into it whatsoever. Hamtaro always sounds bored, and it really broke the immersion for me. Sorry, but Kurumi Mamiya was clearly the better choice, and I'm glad they recast Nagasawa when the TV show got made.So yeah, it's nothing that'll bring the house down, but if you're looking for a nice, wholesome time killer, feel free to check this out. It's a cute prelude to the TV show that would come later. Also, for the love of God, somebody PLEASE release the entirety of Hamtaro on DVD or Blu-Ray!! I want to own the series and relive my childhood!! It deserves to be seen in full so very very much! Yoohoo, Discotek, this anime has your name on it and would be perfect for you!!;Recommended

The story line was left for the viewer to figure out exactly. How they went in portraying their message i was not a fan of. For example i understood the message as a boy/sister's struggle to fitting in/bullying. so why did i need to see a dancing frog? or the boy's penis? or the pus protruding out of a semi ripe pimple. this is not listed as a horror flick is it? i sure don't recall it.The art needs a tune up. I saw some faces as the scene changed but i was not sure who i was seeing the mother/father you get the idea. In addition to that the dark! fine, i understand i was tempted(didn't) to cover my eyes at the gross scenes i did not expect the animation to do that for me. I understand you want to film/illustrate scenes that occur in the dark but come on there are better ways to do that then doing a simple blackout. For example why not put on a light filter for the viewer.;Not Recommended

0;Torajima no Miime;BlaizeV;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlaizeV;7;Two of my favourite things in this world are Cats and the creations of Leiji Matsumoto. So understandably I watched this 2 episode short as soon as I knew it existed.Based on Matsumoto's Manga of the same name this OVA follows the story of a tabby cat named Mii-kun and her new family. Inspired by Matsumoto's childhood pet cat by the same name.The first story is about Mii-kun meeting up with her new adopted family and then about a neighborhood stray going to dangerous means in order to win her heart. This is followed by a second story which sees an old pet cat to the family return, after a decade of being feral, for one last night.The two stories are basic but also quite melodramatic. Given that Matsumoto's style is melodrama this isn't much of a surprise but it does bring a smile to my face to think he could even make the life and times of a kitten a family melodrama but that's what this is.The Animation is digital and for 1999 this is an actually pretty solid looking production, the style of Matsumoto comes across and the colors are vibrant. It's not the best digital art from the era by any means but its perfectly suitable and nice to look at. The Soundtrack is also similarly solid and suitable, nothing amazing but gets the job done just fine.Overall for the 20 minutes or so these two stories take to watch I can easily say I recommend it. Leiji Matsumoto fans and Cat lovers will definitely find something to enjoy here.;Recommended
0;Nonsense Monogatari Dai Ippen: Sarugashima;Khazuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Khazuki;7;"""Monkey Island"" is surprisingly interesting, on a kind of meta level. Because there's a lot of anime from this time period (many of which can be found at https://animation.filmarchives.jp/en/) that have this type of simplistic art and animation, and this style of purely visual, gag based comedy. But unlike its contemporaries, Monkey Island comes across almost disturbingly cynical, in addition to being baffling and insane.The film opens with a ship at sea, beset by a sudden storm (with cloud and sea spray beautifully rendered by way of what appears to be sand overlaid on the image). An infant in a box goes overboard, and cries/shouts hard enough to propel itself to shore on a tropical island, whereupon it is adopted by a colony of monkeys, who bring it to ""Mother Monkey"".Mother Monkey has tits (yes, this is very weird). He drains one tit till it shrivels up, grows 5 years before your eyes. Drains the other one, he's 10 years old. And he has the haircut of the MC from Koe no Katachi. Then some baby monkey walks over and wants to be fed, but Mom's empty, so it starts crying.Anyways the human gets into some sort of contest of superiority with two other monkeys, and he's a total asshole. He basically bullies them and laughs at them. And when they demonstrate there are things they can use their tails to do things that he can't, and make fun of him for it, he picks up a crab that had pinched him earlier and weaponizes it, setting it on their tails. He ends up getting expelled from the colony, and rather than trying to make amends, he escalates the situation, using palm trees to sling coconuts at them, until he's forced to flee the island on a raft.Monkey Island is like Tarzan written from the perspective that humanity is inherently evil. The infant gets in a shouting contest with the entire colony almost as soon as he is discovered on the island. He's selfish, gluttonous, and egotistical. He uses his intelligence to fashion tools and weaponize his surroundings to assert dominance. Even his rapid growth is a trope common to monsters like the Xenomorph.Anyways I don't expect anyone else to think much of this film or to attribute much depth to it, but I do think it's worth watching.";Recommended
0;Nonsense Monogatari Dai Ippen: Sarugashima;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;6;Nonsense Story: Monkey Island is pretty whimsical in its narrative and pretty experimental with its animation techniques. The introduction is particularly breathtaking, with some use of physical particles smudged on celluloid to create sea sprays and chemical processing on film to create rather three dimensional clouds. There's a thematic motif throughout the film, where the sole human has been animated with a frame fluidity that the monkeys have not. The monkeys instead have been animated at half the required frame speed (8 fps) to give them a stop motion like discontinuous motion effect.The theme of evolution is constantly played with through the runtime, albeit in a Planet of the Apes sort of way. The monkeys think that the human child is an undeveloped form of monkey since it lacks a tail. Its behavior constantly appears primitive to the monkeys who despise its uncivil ways and isolate said human until it grows it's tail.However, this only breeds hostility within the isolated child, who takes revenge on their celebrations before making his way to the sea - a way of escape from the island and also an escape from the grips of the monkeys.Could this just be a simple movie about monkeys rearing a mischievous baby? Sure. However, given the time period it would be difficult to ignore the metaphorical allegories in place here. The Japanese - a relatively isolated society think of themselves as superior and when visitors arrive automatically deem them as inferior. They cautiously deal with the visitors (Dutch colonists) until they become big enough to become a nuisance and then kick them out. However, the visitor won't leave them alone to meddle in their affairs and promptly crashes into their celebration with a new round of pranks (or conflict) leading them to eventually be chased out.;Mixed Feelings

The cultivation system does seems a little confusing at first cause it has more than one, but eventually it's possible to get a grasp of it. I watched because there were supposed to be romance, and there is (eventually), and also a lot of girls have an interest in the MC.The first girl may seem angry all the time, but often she has a reason to, she has a strong personality and she kinda grows on you.

Literally just about some animals going skiing, which is boring as fucking hell.But, I suppose I'll do a proper review.Story - 1What was the story? I get that a lot of short films aren't really made to have a story, but c'mon. You gotta do more than just FUCKING SKIING. I mean, what's interesting about that? Although the story was horrible however, I understand that it wasn't made to be something great so I really can't say much here. I believe there is no story, and thus this can be pulled into the enjoyment section, which I will write about later.Art - 1I mean, this was made in the 1900s, but so was anime like Evangelion and some Ghibli movies- it looked like absolute shit. With the staticky background and monochromatic colours, it failed to create a level of interest to the viewer. This being said, I don't actually mind this art style that much, but if one wishes to use it, the rest of the film must be executed well. Oria no Ski failed to do that.Sound - 1All I heard was static and used soundtracks in the background; in fact, I can't even remember any particular pieces of music that actually conveyed real emotion. Even if the music is just to help set the light-hearted mood, it needs to be notable and impactful in one way or another. I understand that my expectations are quite high, again, but the work with music in this film seemed to be really lazy.Character - 1What characters? I get that a short film isn't supposed to portray the idea of fantastic characters, but this film didn't even have any characters. Even with fucking Skelter+Heaven we had characters (which were awful and forgettable, but they were still there). If they'd shown us even one personality trait, even just one, then the character score would shoot up.Enjoyment - 1Boring as fuck.

It aired in cinemas in 1983, 4 months after it was shown on TV in a special format, this one here is in wide screen in a higher quality with the same content as the TV special.The story is very easy and simple to follow, our main character Niimi Katsuya joins the baseball club with his friend Karasawa, their goal is to have fun playing baseball and maybe even go to Koushien, along the way they encounter love problems like any other teenagers, Katsuya loves this cute girl who's the baseball team manager Nakao Yuri but of course something will get in their way.I wouldn't say it's your regular sports drama, baseball plays a secondary role in the anime, you don't have to know the rules and the games aren't as technical as shown in other anime like Major or even Touch, you only need to understand who's winning and who's losing. The baseball club is just the setting where the characters connect, our folks aren't that crazy about the sport. It looks like a coming of age story for Katsuya specifically but other boys get some development too.I'd say this movie is mediocre, lots of stuff happen in the first half, introductions and settings and explanations, it's kinda fast paced but not over the place, keep in mind that Katsuya didn't play baseball before this and then quickly becomes a regular. Though he's not the ace of the team, he's just an out fielder and he enjoys it. We get some personal and somewhat emotional scenes about Yuri, Kurahashi and Karasawa in order to understand their relationship with baseball, it looked cliched and forced for me but I watched lots of romance shows, it was totally watchable and not annoying, at least it was very direct and conclusive.What made me to continue watching was the atmosphere and the romance, the anime lets the viewers spend time with our characters, they don't train or play baseball matches all the time and that's a good thing. The boys just want to live their youth, there are some scenes where they just hang out and talk, usual slice of life elements.The romance is complicated and it would have been easily resolved if all the characters would have been direct and confess their true feelings but no anime does that. To be fair, you may argue that Yuri is shy and her crush must remain a mystery till a given time, Katsuya is also shy and afraid of rejection, that's why he accepts to spend time with Yukimi (a girl who likes him), you can basically find excuses for everything.At least the show knows how to set a mood, the music here is superb, when there's a melancholic scene, they add a nice piece to make the viewer more melancholic, a romantic scene will have the best romance song of that era and will make the moment look and feel 10 times better, a lover of 80s music will definitely approve of it.The art style is not that impressive, the characters look very plain and simple drawn, it's the same as any other Adachi manga/anime. The backgrounds aren't special either, from a visual point of view it's just not that good compared to other 80s movies or OVAs. The animation is lacking, there are many shots with little to no movement and the baseball scenes don't leave an impact.I would like to leave the character section blank because there isn't much to add about them but I'll use this opportunity to talk about other romance anime from the 80s to prove a point.- Urusei Yatsura - main guy is the most perverted guy on Earth and the biggest idiot, main girl is a hot alien- Kimagure Orange Road - main guy has ESP, main girl is a tough cookie hard to understand and feisty- Kabocha Wine - main guy is short and funny, main girl is tall- Touch - main characters are twins (one is a perfect athlete, one is a bum), main girl is the perfect childhood friendNow compared to them, you see how our Nine characters have nothing to offer, there's so down to earth it's annoying, for a show with romance, the characters are nothing special, nothing extreme or eccentric. Katsuya doesn't want to be the best, Yuri doesn't talk as much. Yukimi (high school athlete girl) is fun to watch though, she has a bubbly personality and she's very true to her feelings, I like her but many would hate her because she gets in the way of Yuri and Katsuya and she's overbearing. Yamanaka (the guy who likes Yuri) is that macho star of the anime, the ace of Bunan High School and Katsuya's rival sorta. They aren't boring per se but the anime is missing some spice in regards to the characters, I enjoyed it nonetheless but the potential viewer should expect nothing fancy.Overall, it's a decent lighthearted show, not the best from that era but if you wanna lay down and chill, this one is for you, the drama is not even that exaggerated and it's very easy to follow. If you wanna finish the plot, you will have to watch the sequels. All in all, it's a show about the romantic mishaps of the Seishu Baseball Club.;Recommended

0;Nameko-ke no Ichizoku;Pockycrusader;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pockycrusader;7;This is a strange little anime about a family of mushrooms. There's no dialogue and very little to have to read, and very little is explained, so I think this is probably aimed at younger kids.The family is made up of Nameko (regular mushroom), his mom (tall, regular mushroom) and dad (looks like a rock), his older brother (with the Kamina sun glasses), his little sister (who is a cat mushroom, but, yes she's his sister), his little brother (muscular mushroom), and his grandmother (looks like a pickled plum). This wasn't made clear in the first episode, and for some reason Crunchyroll has separated the OP/EDs from the episodes that introduce these characters, so it's a little confusing at first.This is a cute, short slice-of-life anime. Nothing really major happens, but you get a really good idea of what daily life in an average family is like. Each family member gets their own featured time, so you get a better sense of what sort of person/mushroom each family member is. There's some humor - nothing that will have you rolling on the floor, but it's in keeping with the general tone of the stories and will make you chuckle.The music is pretty much low-key atmospheric stuff. It's light and cute and sometimes used for emphasis in certain scenes.Overall, I enjoyed watching this show. It was cute and would make a good palate-cleanser anime between heavier, darker stories if you need a break.Because of its laid-back tempo, its lack of dialogue, and mild storytelling, this is a pretty good anime for kids to watch. Since there are cultural differences, I think it's a good way to introduce kids to how people might live in Japan - so maybe pair it up with a trip to the library.;Recommended

Nice shades... good colors... killer animation.Character: I still found it unclear what the mask served as. How it had a double purpose. How everything came to be. I felt i was almost teleported to an alien planet. I saw everything unfold before me but could not retain further than what i saw.Sound: did not surprise me when i found out the music was of the heavy rock genre. Those not aware of such music i don't care what language it is in most often you will hear bits and pieces the rest you need a printed lyric sheet for. This is one of the reasons i don't like heavy metal. Plus with this music there is no good listening level.... they all hurt my ears.overall: love the art hate the point of the music video, 3.;Not Recommended

0;Dahufa;abystoma2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abystoma2;8;Dahufa is an interesting and unusual title. Althrough having watched bunch of them, I’m not exactly a fan of Chinese anime, but it’s works like this or the Big Fish and Begonia that make me have some faith in the potential of this type of animation.If you’ve already watched some Chinese animations, you might notice that lot of the times the story tends to be confusing and seeming like it leaves out a lot of the info. Usually this leads to the story seeming lacklustre, but in case of Dahufa it actually works. While the story doesn’t explain anything at the start, it opens up with a mysterious and intriguing world that makes you want to continue and see what is going on, and as you continue with the movie the details are slowly being unveiled. It might be a bit far-fetched comparation, but it feels a bit like playing a Dark Souls game for the first time – you get thrown in an unknown world filled with curious creatures and you try to piece together the story from the dialogue of the characters and the scenery around you. And it is a story that actually surprised me with some moments – in a good way, though saying how would be a spoiler.The animation is well done, and while not being that detailed it’s the flow and the movement it excels at. It’s nice to look at and welcomed change from the usual lower budget animations Chinese anime tends to have.Dahufa is a movie that I would recommend even if you’re not interested in watching Chinese animation, and might even be a good starting point for watching it.;Recommended
1;Dahufa;playerriay;https://myanimelist.net/profile/playerriay;8;Well, the first 5 min of the movie I expected to see some childish movie, maybe dreamlike chinese fairy tale, but I was totally wrong, this is a very crude, violent and serious movie, not in the wrong sense, but I wouldnt recommend people with 15 years or less of age to see this movie.The first third of the movie is very mysterious, but the truth is revealed short after it, *spoiler warning*: this movie is about a village of non-human persons being slaved and slaughtered by a tyrant who farm them. *spoiler closed*Not wonder chinese media didnt like this movie, because it handle topics like slavery, fear and ignorance as a way to rule, and dictatorship, also, the ending of the movie is very crude.In the end, is a very crude movie, full of action and violence (even if the blood is not red), that deals with a very serious topic, I can recommend it to whoever is interested in the topic, but it is not a happy movie at all.;Recommended

Sounds like too much shit to clean up for my taste. But that's fine, be a weird doll person that's fine. But then MC sees a girl who looks exactly like the doll, which he finds surprising. I, however, didn't, since it's hentai and there are only so many hair colors and generic faces for someone to have. He lures her to his house, dresses her up, then fucks her. I shit you not he forces her to self insert the doll into her vagina... lol She does, which then transforms her into the doll's personality (how?) and she turns the MC into a doll as revenge (weird flex) and she dips.

Hard to really enjoy when the main character is deranged like he was, but its not the worse story or main character out there either.The art is definitely sub-par for a hentai, with blob like features on the characters, noticeable missing details, and scenes that are blindingly bright in color that it almost looks life its been washed with brightening filter.

0;100-nichikan Ikita Wani;InfinityDude88;https://myanimelist.net/profile/InfinityDude88;5;After having thoroughly enjoyed the original manga a number of moths ago, I was equally as excited to experience the anime adaptation of 100-nichikan Ikita Wani and see exactly how they would adapt what was an incredibly short, incredibly bittersweet story into a feature length film. The answer to this conundrum turned out to be very simple - they didn't.Story - (4)Character - (5)Clocking it at a mere 63 minutes, this film barely managed to meet the minimum of what one could consider worthy of a theatrical release and even at that meager runtime, only half of the film is an actual adaptation of the source material. While I do entirely understand that they were always going to have to make drastic changes to make the story work as a cohesive work of cinema, rather than individual ten second jokes, I feel as though they ended up losing track of what made the original story so great. The relatability of Wani's struggles and the theme of making the most of one's life while they can were both essential elements to the charm of the manga that were glossed over in a mere 25-30 minutes in the film. Instead of focusing in on these key elements, the film chooses to introduce an entirely new plotline set 100 days after the end of the manga, telling the tale of Kaeru and his similar attempt at befriending the other characters of the story. While this new content does make a semi-successful attempt at showing the ways in which one can overcome and move on from grief, it ultimately feels largely superfluous given how unrelated it is from the original point of the story. The characters themselves also ended up disappointing compared to the manga. While some of their individual personalities and character traits did shine through, the short runtime again hindered the ability for any true insight or connection to be made.Art - (5)Sound - (6)Both the art and sound of 100-nichikan Ikita Wani were fine enough, though lacking in any particular stand out moments. Obviously the first element that one may notice when viewing the artwork of the film is the character designs, with each character being portrayed as a different anthropomorphized animal. While there is not anything inherently wrong with the designs, with each one being pleasant enough to look at, it was mildly disappointing to see no real meaning behind these designs. Where other recent series such as Beasters and Odd Taxi utilized the animal designs in interesting and unique ways for greater story, character and artistic purposes, this film simply goes with the designs out of the generic quest to create an instant cute appeal to the art. The actual animation was rather lackluster as well, with there being very little animation outside of simple dialogue scenes. The score, while slightly better in comparison, was also nothing to write home about. Though any music that did play was sweet and pleasant to listen to, the large gaps in-between such appearances left me wishing there was more.Enjoyment - (5)Though the short runtime of the film did bring many other issues into play, it at least did help prevent the film from getting boring or stale at any point, with the film ultimately flying be fairly fast. In addition, the solid foundation of the story on which the film was based meant that I overall did not dislike the film. Instead, I was simply left feeling let down and mildly frustrated at how an enjoyable little manga had been turned into such a bland and uninspired film. Thus I must insist that to any who have read this far and are genuinely interested in the premise of this story, the manga is a far better experience, being both more entertaining and slightly shorter than the film.Overall - (5)In summary, though not exactly being a bad film overall, 100-nichikan Ikita Wani is an incredibly bland and uninspired adaptation of a charming short web manga that would have ultimately been better off being left as such.;Mixed Feelings

0;Gorillaman;simo_omis;https://myanimelist.net/profile/simo_omis;7;fans may be familiar with ‘Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad,’ Harold Sakuishi’s long running series about a rock band. Prior to ‘Beck’s’ start in 1999, however, Sakuishi had already put out three separate series, their earlier styles almost unidentifiable to his more modern hit. In 1988, his debut work ‘Gorillaman’ began in Young Magazine, during a period when delinquent youth, or “yanki,” manga were a major subgenre within boys’ and mens’ anthologies.like many yanki manga, it never received a TV anime adaption.Gorillaman did have an OVA.The series opens with a tough-looking, suit-clad man walking down the street, when suddenly a bucket of water falls from a construction site and hits the passerby flat on the head. As workmen rush to his side, we catch our first close look at the protagonist, whose facial features seem rather exaggerated. Was it a result of the accident, as I initially thought?No, as it turns out, his face just happens to resemble that of a gorilla’s, hence the title. In fact, we quickly learn that he isn’t a salaryman or a gangster, but rather a student named Ikedo , who is transferring into Shiratake High School. Nicknamed “Gorillaman”.Ikedo starts things off on the wrong foot just by being his usual self. He is completely mute, which frustrates faculty while making him a target of bullying among some students. While walking to his seat, Ikedo is tripped by Fujimoto, a more traditional looking yanki student who becomes a sort of secondary protagonist for the story.The charismatic and sociable Fujimoto leads the “Fujimoto Corps,” a gang of various other fellow delinquents within the school. In many ways, Fujimoto fits the role of the goofy, good-spirited yanki protagonist,Fujimoto tends to play the role of protagonist to a degree, with conflicts and romances centered mostly around him, while Ikedo falls into the background as seemingly just another follower.;Recommended

0;Super Kuma-san;Archaeon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Archaeon;7;"One of the things I love about the Animax Taisho is that the winning screenplays are often imaginative, inventive, and sometimes very odd. A prime example of this is Super Kuma-san, the winner of the first Animax Taisho back in 2002.Written by Tani Hiromasa, the OVA was directed by Kaizawa Yukio (Digimon Frontier/Tamers, Binbou Shimai Monogatari), and produced by Toei, and featured a surprising number of experienced voice actors among the cast.The story is about a toy bear called Kuma, who has come to life for some unknown reason. He has taken it upon himself to protect his town from villains, vandals and hoodlums, and transforms into Super Kuma-san to do this. One day though, the town is protected by something new. Another toy has come to life, and this time it's a doll.To be honest, this is one of those shows that asks more questions than it answers. It would have been niceto have some explanations about why Kuma and Doll are alive, why the town has so much crime, why the police are so inept that they must rely on toys for protection, etc, etc, but answers are not forthcoming. However, given that this is a single episode OVA and is aimed primarily at children, there is not the time, nor was there any inclination from the start, to develop the story to any degree.That said, Super Kuma-san is a rather charming little tale, and while there is a very child friendly atmosphere to the show, it isn't drowned in sugary sweetness, but instead tempers events by adding some darker elements. The use of flashbacks serves as a nice, if brief, glimpse into the history of both Kuma and Doll, however it's nowhere near enough to give any real understanding of their characters.As far as OVAs go, Super Kuma-san looks pretty good for the most part. The characters are generally well designed, if a little on the plain side. The area where the design really does shine though, is in the emotive expression of both Kuma and Doll. Essentially both characters have static features which don't change too much regardless of what they're feeling. It's surprising then, that Kuma is able to express a wide variety of emotions simply by changing the shape of his mouth, while Doll is positively chilling at certain points. Another surprising design aspect is Kuma's ""berserk"" mode, one of the darker elements I mentioned earlier, and it's nice to see that there was no attempt to shy away from showing Kuma lose his temper.The show is well animated on the whole. The characters move well for the most part, and the action sequences are well choreographed. That said, certain aspects of the design and animation are very much aimed at children, so there are moments when things seem a little too simplistic.The music is pretty simplistic throughout the OVA, with most of it being reminiscent of the music heard at circuses and funfairs (including the creepy music box tune). The seiyuu are pretty good for the most part, but older people may find the acting a little too simple, however it should be remembered that this is very much a children's show.I was surprised though, to find Yamadera Kouichi (Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop), playing the role of Clown (something he manages to do with aplomb by the way).Given that this is a single episode OVA aimed at kids, it's understandable that there would be very little in the way of character development. That said, the show does make some nods in this direction by providing some brief details about the history of Kuma and Doll. The only other prominent characters are Maa-kun and Clown, however they are simply supporting characters for Kuma, and Doll later on.I'm quite surprised to admit that I actually quite enjoyed Super Kuma-san, although it has to be said that my 6 year old nephew enjoyed it far more than I did. The show is quirky, and more than a little odd, and while it is very clearly aimed at children, it doesn't do any harm to watch something completely non-offensive from time to time.That said, the show doesn't really attempt to answer any of it's own questions, however such gripes are very much the realms of teenagers and adults. This is a kids show after all.";Recommended
0;Long She Yanyi;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;8;"This donghua is adapted from a novel but since I have not read it, I will not comment on how well this does as an adaptation.Now onto the review; my review can be summed up into 3 words: HOT MODERN GIRLS!!! The end, that's all folks.On a more serious note, the basic plot summary is as follows: The story takes place in what appears to be a modern world similar to our own (but with somewhat supernatural martial arts). Our MC, Wang Chao, is a recent high school graduate (at least seems to be at 19 yo) now attending either college or technical school, who is lost and confused, like many of the modern generation. He lacks confidence, direction and is picked on by others; he wants to be a hero much like Bruce Lee(?), but lacks both the skill and means (he's poor) to do so. One day during his daily commute, he notices a woman exercising in a park and instinctively feels she is not ordinary and thus watches her practice. This eventually leads to the two interacting and the woman, Tang Zichen, to teach him the basics. After the basics, she decides to teach him as a disciple after testing his character and thus Wang Chao now step by step, enters the martial arts world: the business side, the martial arts side, and slowly but surely into the more nefarious, darker side.The plot primarily follows our MC, Wang Chao, and it is clearly meant to be a story about him; we can clearly see this as there are quite a few scenes focusing on the womans' sex appeal, much like what a ""horny teen"" would focus on, especially when Wang Chao is either distracted or flashbacks by the MC. This donghua can be considered a story of Wang Chao's journey into the martial arts world; as his skill increases, he is qualified to meet with more skilled and influential practitioners, and thus the world we see/understand grows. The story is well-paced and Wang Chao's growth as a person is quite believable; he goes from a low confidence nobody to become an overconfident and naive fool who gets taken advantage of, but at least he learns from it and comes out better by the end of the donghua.The action/fights are quite well choreographed and smooth. While not a martial arts expert myself, the theories and fights seem to have at least some basis on what we have in real life. The character models are beautiful and environments are beautifully rendered. There is a great competition and fight to cap off the season, with a lead in to an obvious season 2.Overall, great prologue/season 1. I highly recommend this if you like wuxia/martial arts themed stories.";Recommended

0;You Shoumei Bijutsukan Line;NotDolphy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NotDolphy;8;"You Shoumei Bijutsukan Line is an unusual ga-nime featuring a mix of You Shomei's minimalistic paintings, an equally barren soundscape courtesy of Nakai Yuu, and tranquil live action sections peppered throughout.You's artwork here invariably consists of two horizontally split halves, creating a line effect in the middle of which this ga-nime is eponymous of. Sky comprises the top half, a seemingly perfectly flat surface on the bottom: both largely featureless but characterized by gentle gradients and soft colors. These stark landscapes are punctuated by lone objects, vaguely reminiscent of their respective real-life counterparts. Abstract at first, these objects take the shape of minuscule, dark rectangles— then later more defined structures— like a primitive church or what appears to be a lighthouse. These staunchly geometric shapes, while diminutive compared to the vastness of the landscapes they're up against, carry a strong effect. Paintings depicting a tiny black rectangle, dwarfed by such monolithic environments; evoke feelings of loneliness and powerlessness. There's a strange, unsettling beauty that permeates You's otherworldly and desolate art.There's no actual animation to speak of in You Shoumei Bijutsukan Line. Slow pans and zooms do their job to accentuate certain aspects of the paintings, but there's nothing beyond that in terms of animation techniques. However, You's motionless world is brought to life aurally in a big yet understated way. Whether it be slow and ethereal drones, reverb-drenched bass notes that quietly interrupt the predominant silence, or arrhythmic electronic galloping: the largely neutral paintings are given tone and feeling by their audio counterpart. A simple house becomes a lugubrious figure at the hands of high-pitched synth moans. It gives the sense that the art and music were designed to go together since the production's conception. Whether this is the case or not, the impeccable marriage of sight and sound is to be truly admired.The live action segments, on the other hand, are a bit of a mixed bag. Most of them consist of one man in an almost entirely empty white room, slowly, slowly soliloquizing. Paradoxically, these segments have a tendency to be both cloyingly cryptic and preachy at once. For example, there's a scene where the actor sheds a single tear as he slowly gropes the bare white floor, lamenting ""The land continues to suffer"", apropos of nothing. It would not be hard for one to make a case for this being pretentious, but even beyond that, it's more than just a little cringe-inducing. Although these segments were probably intended to give the audience greater perspective on the author's intent, these ancillary segments manage to shoot holes in the otherwise stellar ambiance. The art would have been better off if allowed to speak for itself.However, these segments are not totally without merits. For example, there's one scene where it cuts from the glacially-paced painting segments to a live action clip of an ant frantically fighting for its life in a glass of water, paired with exaggerated splashing sound effects. While it's tough to parse any concrete meaning from this, the effect of the juxtaposition is subconsciously very affecting. Moments like this one provide ample justification for You's choice in medium, as this effect could not have been accomplished by merely hanging his paintings up in a gallery.What does this all amount to? Well, a pretty neat slab of atmosphere, for one. A unique marvel— the enlivening of a traditionally static medium— for another. And finally, sight and sound conspiring together in a wondrously meditative vein. Minor shortcomings aside, immersing yourself in You Shoumei's world is a worthwhile endeavor.";Recommended
0;You Shoumei Bijutsukan Line;triela-chan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/triela-chan;1;"If you like kino or art house, you might enjoy this. But otherwise, it's definitely not worth your time.I'm not even sure what to call this show, since I wouldn't call it an anime or OVA. I don't recall seeing any animation; it's mostly just a long series of paintings shown one after another, each one being slowly panned over by the camera. And when I say that, I mean SLOWLY. Painfully slowly. You could probably watch this at 5x speed and not miss out on much. Some may argue that this pace allows every viewer ample time to scrutinise every fine detail of the paintings. Instead, it ensures that for each painting, every viewer is absolutely certain that they've seen enough.The show repeatedly alternates between this snail's-pace slideshow and live-action shots of a man lazing around aimlessly. Many of these shots are set in an endless white void. It's hard to tell if it's meant to be a mediocre imitation of The Matrix or a pretentious, abstract visual metaphor for something (perhaps the show's amount of creativity and meaning).Throughout all of this, there's some voiceover dialogue to accompany the visuals. But it just sounds like the rambling of an art student who's trying to sound profound but has nothing meaningful to say. Sometimes there will be ambient noise, which either *is* music or takes the place of music, depending on who you ask.The only thing saving this show from being completely empty are a small number of close-up shots of an ant nearly drowning, only to be saved by the man. This is followed by an awkward shot of him holding it up to his face; I'm fairly certain they were trying to portray him as closely examining the ant while pondering the fragility of life, but to me, it just looked like he was gonna eat it. Combined with the dialogue, this sequence about the ant came off to me as an awkward attempt to make philosophical commentary on the nature life and death, while simultaneously trying to avoid the ire of whatever the Japanese equivalent of PETA is.Overall, this show ends up feeling extremely pretentions, made only worse by how dreadfully slow it moves. There's virtually no story or characters to speak of, and whatever message they're attempting to communicate is vague and hollow. The sound is bland, the live-action scenes are either awkward or boring, and there's no animation to speak of. The art itself (i.e. the paintings) are not necessarily bad, but they're not great either. The live-action cinematography has a gloomy colour palette of black and white and grey, cloaked in a slight but noticeable tinge of mouldy yellow. Stylistically, the paintings and cinematography create an overarching sense of emptiness. Not the kind that's aesthetically or philosophically interesting, but the kind that bores you to sleep.";Not Recommended
0;Yodomi no Sawagi;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;5;I watched a version of this without subtitles, so that may be clouding my judgment of what's going on to an extent, but there is very little dialogue in this short, and it relies heavily on visual storytelling and symbolism.First of all, I have to say, the beginning sequence with the man being hanged is darkly funny, but it is an immersion breaker. The girl who is hanging him looks so tiny that I'm not fully convinced she would be able to hoist him up in the first place, but even overlooking that the only quick way for someone to die in this manner is if they are dropped from a significant enough height for the neck to be broken, as would happen with a properly constructed gallows. The way the man was slowly lifted up would result in a slow strangulation death and a lot more suffering, yet he was quickly offed in all but 4 seconds... how can I be immersed into the short at all when this happens? They could have easily cut away, but the director seemed content to make this scene without shot transitions. I feel like I'm watching some crappy 1960s TV series rather than an art film. That alone prevented me from giving this a 6, to be honest. I know it may seem petty, but if someone is going to put this much effort into a short film, they ought to at least think basic events like this through.The art features simple line work and shading, and it creates a nice contrast that complements the mood of the short well, which is also furthered by the sound design. The character art is quite simple and allows for effective character movement. There's nothing especially bad here, although I'm sure many would prefer more detailed art. The composition is generally well-chosen.Thematically, this is pretty simple. There's a rather cumbersome corpse lying in the middle of the living room, and there are various psychotic breaks the main experiences, and eventually what she's trying to hide envelopes the interior of the house and seeps into the external world. There are several scenes along the way that lend the short film a surreal quality.Nothing too special, but it's not bad...;Mixed Feelings

Artwork of characters demonstrate possible poor quality of production. For there is no by Japanese slang terminology cuteness. But I think the director was smart. If you read into plot you find story takes place for certain characters in far past. Beauty as we know today wouldn’t have existed back then. For little by little like everything we know such as strawberries has been broken down from things of dislike and expanded on areas of interest. Main complaint I had was the minor helper character. To me character should have made sense with a character of past by not being seen as a character of future.

0;Hana no Asukagumi! 2: Lonely Cats Battle Royale;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;5;Oh well let's do this one more time, an anime without a review. I must say this first, I watched this thanks to the youtuber called Kenny Lauderdale who loves watching old and obscure anime stuff like me and made possible that this OVA be releasedfinally to the whole internet.So without further ado let's go.With Old anime you must have some things clear, there is a difference between Tv anime and OVA anime during the 80s and 90s, because with TV anime they follow mostly the source material they had, be a manga, a book, a light novel, etc and with the latter expect so many WTFs because the stories are really messed up sometimes and you have to read that source material to understand what is going on and not like the opposite like it is done today.Having said that we have a clear example with Hana no Asugami 2. This OVA is based on a manga that features girl delinquets or sukeban like it is called in japanese which was very popular during those years cause if you have time to look at OVA being sold during that time, there is a lot of that genre. Although with this one it is just so random in the sense that things happen and it is just way too convuluted to comprehend.The story is about a battle royal that will happen among the strongest delinquent girls around the city this show takes place because... reasons and the winner will get... something I guess (?). This is the premise of this thing which shows that you have to read the manga to understand what the hell is going. This OVA is just pure fight scenes and some flashbacks that doesn't make sense at all and that's all that you can get. In other words it is just bad. It has some cool fight scenes but it is so static.The characters are delinquents and just that. It is hard to see some development when there is none and even calling them tropes is just not ok. These characters are just girls fighting and nothing more.The animation is bad. I can pass on anime being old and and not having flawless animation like it is done today but this one looks so effortless by Toei. The fight scenes are so quick and don't have an impact except for one that happens during the night and the way Asuka uses her coin weapon it was cool. But again it is static and without any emotion to every punch or any attack.The character desing is also bad. Many girls look like they copy and pasted the same face on them and just added different hair cuts and that was all. Looks kinda boring in my opinion.The sound is ok, with all these weird OVAs you get a lot of synthwave soundtracks which is enjoyable and some random pop music of the time that sometimes you don't expect. The inserted songs are good and enjoyable but the voice actors are just meh. Nothing stands out but they do the best.Overall this is just one those old anime that if you are curious about anime history you should check it out, but again there is nothing of value of this thing except that is not lost media. It isn't that horrible like many other stuff I have found in this website but again don't raise your expectations and just look at a piece of media that was made in 1990 just to find out that the ammount of many kinds of anime that exist.;Mixed Feelings

One day a club forms that starts a battle royale between a bunch of different gangs or individuals. Asuka is put in to the battle without her knowledge. This story may be original but that doesn’t mean it’s good. It’s fun at first but then it gets boring quickly.Art: 4/10I’m just gonna be blunt and say this, the animation is awful. Most of the scenes the characters look stiff and there’s even time where they just put 1-3 still images moving for scenes with crowds.Sound: 6/10Not much to say here. The voice acting pretty good for it’s timeCharacter: 5/10Ok so basically Asuka is the only character. I mean yes there is other characters but they don’t have much to them at all, I can’t even remember their names. There is a scene where it shows a flashback to Asuka’s past and gives some insight on why she might have chose to become a delinquent but it’s not great. There is this one girl who shows up in the beginning who is anorexic and gets bullied. She sorta goes through some development at the end. In last few scenes she says she going to try as hard as she to start eating again, which is nice.Enjoyment:5/10I’d recommend this to anyone who is bored honestlyThis is my first review so please take it with a grain of salt,sorry if there is any grammar mistakes, etc.;Mixed Feelings

0;Hana no Asukagumi! 2: Lonely Cats Battle Royale;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;"“Lonely Cats Battle Royale,” a spinoff of 1987’s “Shin Kabukicho Story: Hana no Asukagumi!” OVA, has some positive aspects, such as a promising start and decent music, but it’s rather subdued and lackluster compared to the original story.The gist of the plot is that Asuka, and her friends Hime and Miko, have been put into a “battle royale”-style fighting bracket without their knowledge or consent, and they have to fend off various groups of delinquent girls attacking them while trying to get to the bottom of who created this bracket and why. Provided you know who the characters are, the setup is okay and is easy to follow, but as the story unfolds, it begins to fall apart. The reveal of the culprit behind the bracket, as well as the reason for making the girls fight, is explained clumsily. The climax is drawn out and boring, and although they try to wrap it up at the end, the characters’ interactions with each other don’t feel genuine. Compared to the over-the-top antics of “Shin Kabukicho Story,” “Lonely Cats Battle Royale” is underwhelming.The characters act roughly the same as they do in the first OVA, but since there’s a different character designer here, some of them look different, particularly Miko. I didn’t even realize she was supposed to be Miko at first. Asuka is even tougher and meaner than she was in “Shin Kabukicho Story,” and she comes across as not being very likable here. Neither Hime nor Miko stand out very much, and Yasuhiro shows up briefly and adds little to the story. “Lonely Cats Battle Royale” has its own set of bullying schoolgirls, just like “Shin Kabukicho Story,” but the interactions between the bullies and their victim, as well as the bullies’ motivations, seem forced. Asuka’s way of dealing with them in “Lonely Cats Battle Royale” also isn’t as satisfying as it was in the first OVA.The animation is serviceable, but subpar, and as touched on above, the designs for some of the returning characters are different. Also, many of the new characters look bland, compared to the outlandish designs in “Shin Kabukicho Story.” The voice acting is average. The music is decent, particularly the catchy, upbeat ending theme. The direction isn’t very good; it’s hard to tell what’s going on at times.As for potentially objectionable content, “Lonely Cats Battle Royale” has fighting, blood and references to drugs. Also, gambling plays a major role in the background of the story, as do anorexia and bullying. This OVA is a bit tamer in general than the first one, though.Overall, while there are a few positive aspects to this OVA, it’s missing the spark that the first one had, and thus comes across as dull, and with a messy plot on top of that.

0;Kyouryuu Shoujo Gauko 2nd Season;LovelyTekki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LovelyTekki;8;While I had a very mixed opinion of Dino Girl Gauko's first season, I am glad to see that the show improved by a long shot in it's second season. I recommend looking at my review for the previous season for better context.My issue with the first season is that the show was very formulaic and it gets hard to care about characters who pretty much do nothing but intentionally upset Naoko for a cruel joke, but in this season the characters have improved overall. Saito, the know it all kid, shows that he has a lot more to him than thinking he's better than everyone else. Takashi is not used as much in this season, so he's not as much of an issue. Even Babulissa is a lot funnier in this season, though she's less of an antagonist than in season one. The only characters who don't improve too much are the aliens, but they're alright as they are.The show still follows it's short 10 minute episode style, but one way it improved in this episode was that it finishes all it's stories. It made for a much more interesting show when they remembered to solve the problems they established early on. Just like the first season, you could watch a few episodes when you want something light and fluffy, or binge the whole season in one go.The art and sound design stays pretty much consistent. No drops or upgrades to animation quality, it's pretty much the same. As I said in my previous review, I really like the aesthetic and world this series makes and it's almost reminiscent of the American animated series OK KO! The unique and wacky character designs are one of the series' strongest points.Overall, I am glad that Dino Girl Gauko improved in it's second season, and the upgrade in writing and characters makes me curious to see where a potential 3rd season of the show could go. :);Recommended
0;Kamigawa: Kagayakeru Sekai;abystoma2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abystoma2;7;For „just“ a commercial, this short anime is noticeably high effort. As a long time player of MtG, this put a smile on my face.Stylized as a music video, Kamigawa: Kagayakeru Sekai aims to tell a story with the running time it has, rather to just present a product, and it works quite nice. If not for the screen at the end telling you “Available Everywhere”, this would absolutely pass as just a regular music video or a trailer for a longer work rather than an ad. The script and the video editing work greatly with the music to create an emotional experience, managing to convey the characters and their feels without any dialogue.The visuals are also a treat – the aesthetics of Neon Kamigawa (which for those who aren’t familiar with Magic: the Gathering is fantasy cyberpunk set in fictional reimagination of Japanese culture) are already captivating, and were transferred to motion well. My only complaint would be that due to being released on youtube, even the FullHD 1080p video could use some improvement to video quality, but it’s not like we can get bluray-like source for this.If you’re not a fan of MtG, you might still enjoy this to an extent, even if you don’t recognize the characters. It’s worth watching even if just for the visuals and the sound.Overall, I have watched this multiple times, leaving me with the feeling on how much I would love a full anime series set in the MtG universe.

Still as smart and witty, it combines the best of both seasons, that is, the uncanny and hilarious nonsense cg gags as well as numerous pop culture references or even a new concept that goes in the continuity of dubbing lake, the 4koma manga line game, it won't disappoint you on these parts.But you'd be a fool to think this is just a 1 hour long regular episode ! While at the first glance it would seem to be the case, it is in reality much more ambitious than that, using its methodically planned lore to its full extent in a high fantasy setting as rich and dark as those of lotr or berserk (monsters are as dreadful as its cgi) it doesn't hesitate to kill and torture its characters in a tomino fashion that could remind you of ideon.I won't go in depth as to not spoil the fun of it but how the movie uses foreshadowing or the Chekhov's gun are mindboggingly impressive.Characterwise, our 3 adorable fairies are still the same as ever, what makes this movie superior in my opinion is the new group of multiethnical idols denpagumi that manages to put all the love live sunshine cast to shame, they didn't hesitate, for this occasion to use plenty of different musics and that's saying something considering than a single track represents a significantly heavier part of the budget than all its animation. It also reintegrates some of the side characters from the tv series and bring them in a new light to the audience.I'm probably preaching to the choir if you already cared to check this but this is definitely a sequel worth watching, improving on many aspects from its predecessors.;Recommended
0;Xi You Ji;whither;https://myanimelist.net/profile/whither;9;"Note: this review is about the original Chinese release in 1999, not the English dub / edit.This show was key in introducing my childhood self to ancient Chinese mythology, culture and literature. It made one of China’s “Four Great Classical Novels” extremely accessible to a younger audience. I swear China has at least one new modern adaptation for “Journey to the West” every year (what can I say – we all love it!), but this cartoon remains one of the best. The original story remains a huge influence for modern media, from Dragon Ball, to RWBY, to League of Legends.This review will be a blend between my impression of this show as a young child first experiencing it and as a young adult revisiting it.______________________________________________Story: 9/10It’s a classic story that works really well for adaptation purposes: it has a huge expansive world, a wide cast of characters firmly cemented in something the audience already knows (in this case, classic Chinese mythology), a tale of unlikely friends banding together to achieve a great goal, dynamic and round characters who all have their own extensive past, a huge variety of obstacles and villains to conquer, etc. These are the hallmarks of great adventure stories, and are common elements in successful stories today as well.The story structure is familiar; there is one big overarching adventure with a huge goal that the protagonists slowly approach, and smaller arcs with different antagonists and supporting protagonists. It’s a narrative structure that has withstood the test of time, and one that is used by modern stories (like shounen) over and over.Now that I’m older I can recognize and appreciate these themes, but honestly as a little kid I just had a blast feeling like I was a part of the adventure and friends with the characters, defeating all those who stand in our way and being badass. When you watch this, you can read into it deeper and delve into some Chinese myth, history, and culture to enrich your experience, or just enjoy this as an easy-viewing fun filled adventure. Both work well for this show.______________________________________________Art/Animation: 10/10This is something I couldn’t really appreciate as a child, but watching the cartoon recently, I can see the limitations in traditional animation from the 90s. Keeping that in mind as the basis of judgement, I think the quality is wonderful. The character designs really captured the personality the cast. The way the characters move also represents their personality. The background art is beautifully coloured and detailed. The animators did a wonderful job of translating traditional Chinese art into a modern cartoon – not only representing the fashion and architecture of the time, but also drawing inspiration from classic Chinese paintings.This story is filled with action, and the fight scenes are dynamically animated. You won’t find any lame freeze frame character glamour shots with a blurry background whizzing behind them here. The characters move fluidly and the hits have weight. Due to the nature of the character’s powers, the fights are especially flashy.______________________________________________Sound: 10/10The opening and closing themes are absolutely iconic. I still know them by heart after almost two decades. The background music is great at communicating different moods, particularly comedy and tension.The voice acting is solid and all the actors sound exactly the way the characters should. After over 50 film/television adaptations of this story, there are specific voices people associate with the cast, and this cartoon does all of them very well. (Note: I have only ever seen the Mandarin version. I only just found out there is apparently an English dub, though I’ve never managed to find it. I recommend trying the Mandarin version with subs. I checked out a bit of it and the translation seems to be as accurate as a Chinese to English translation can get.)______________________________________________Character: 8/10This show begins with the origins of Sun WuKong, establishing him as the main focus of the show. I think WuKong might be the original “overpowered protagonist”. Out of the main cast of 4 (or 5 if you count the horse), he is without a doubt everyone’s favourite. One of the simplest pleasures of life is watching a lovable character become stronger and stronger, and outsmart and defeat their enemies in spectacular ways. The other characters also have interesting pasts that are depicted in the show (even the horse), but there is no doubt WuKong is the star. He has been many people’s childhood hero (including me for sure).A lot of WuKong’s personality and powers can be seen in modern shounen anime (Goku and Naruto for example). He is the original lovable hotheaded but trustworthy and playful guy with incredible skills who is always fighting for what’s right and defending his friends. Without a doubt, Journey to the West has been a huge influencer of Eastern culture and media. Because this story draws so much from Chinese mythology, I could recognize characters from other stories I’d heard, and connect everything in my mind to form a richer narrative. Foreign audiences may lose this layer of detail, but the characters are strong enough on their own that this won’t detract much from your experience.______________________________________________Enjoyment: 10/10I was completely enamored with this series when I was growing up. I would watch the whole thing endless on repeat with my box set of DVDs. One day recently I was feeling particularly nostalgic and watched it again for old time’s sake. I wasn’t completely mind blown and rendered motionless by pure wonder like I was as a kid, obviously, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. There’s a surprising amount of detail and subtlety that I realized I had missed as a kid, which makes me believe that an older audience can enjoy it as well.______________________________________________Overall: 9/10If I was still 5 years old I would give this show an 11/10. Nostalgia often clouds people’s vision when judging something they loved as a kid, but I genuinely think this is an unbiased review. For this one show that I loved as a kid that I still love now, there are dozens of other shows that I have tossed out of mind.Watching this show at my current age, I can see how the animation may feel outdated, or how the plotline and characters may feel too simple for a more mature audience. Its also very possible that someone with no background in Chinese culture or mythology will find some parts of the plot or characters harder to understand. This story is built upon a lot of established myths and deities, and doesn’t always explain things in depth. A significant amount of cultural significance is lost without this background knowledge, but even without it, a foreign audience can still appreciate this show and perhaps even use it as a starting point to learn more about Chinese culture. The fantasy world this show builds is strong enough on its own to stand as an independent work of art.This cartoon or “dong hua pian"" is still viewed as an example of great classic Chinese animation, and it has played a role in being the predecessor of the all the successful elements of adventure stories. Of course, it's also just good fun to watch, and easy to take in.";Recommended
1;Xi You Ji;Recynon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Recynon;9;"Journey to the West is one of the oldest action adventure tales as well as one of the oldest examples of the five man band trope (yes, the horse counts) but this incarnation of the tale still holds up as a highly original work in a landscape saturated with action-adventure shows inspired from it. The most prominent of these is Dragon Ball Z, and I'm just going to come out and say it: Xi You Ji walks all over Dragon Ball Z even when I remove my nostalgia glasses. Yes, it's still mainly an action-adventure series aimed at kids so there won't be much intellectual substance, long, complex story arcs, deep characters, nor emotional drama. It doesn't reach for these things either, as its tone, visuals, and music indicate that it's an honest attempt to tell fun, episodic adventures, and its plentiful charm allows it to succeed in this. Whereas Dragon Ball Z's 2 episode long constipating contests, poorly handled power creep, and corny hero-villain dialogue make it inaccessible to viewers who didn't grow up with it, Xi You Ji's charm holds up for both kids and adults just like Tom and Jerry's childish slapstick comedy is timeless.(Edit: To say that Xi You Ji has nothing to say of substance would be inaccurate. The Journey to the West is about the individual's journey to cultivate the self. Wukong represents the mind, Tripitaka represents the heart, Pigsy represents our base instincts, and Sandy represents our common sense. We need to balance all these aspects of the self and in order to do so, we must go through numerous tribulations. Tripitaka's compassion and spirituality leads him to be too trusting towards demons and lands him in trouble and that's why he needs Wukong's cunning intellect, practicality, and ability to do what needs to be done. Wukong on the other hand, suffers from lack of self-restraint and spirituality. Compassion and spirituality must be tempered by logic and practicality. When Wukong decides to leave Flower Fruit Mountain and continue his journey, his monkey subjects beg him not to leave. They tell him that if he goes, he will suffer numerous hardships whereas if he stays, he can enjoy being king and having everything at his disposal. Wukong replies that he must go, because going through the 82 tribulations is honing his soul and his character. )Most of this charm comes from the mandarin voice acting itself (which is fantastic, especially in the delivery of the comedic moments) and Son Wukong's personality. Mischievous, clever, persistent, and rebellious, Son Wukong stands up for what he believes is right, with a particular disdain for pompous authority figures. Moreover, he can back it up. His journey from a monkey born out of a giant rock to Monkey King, to Great Sage Equal to Heaven, is equal parts empowering in the way he takes on all of Heaven and wins.Endearingly humorous, he answers trickery and connivery with clever wit and even greater trickery stemming from his monkey mischievousness. Here is what separates Xi You Ji from most other action-adventure series/shounen. The action conflicts are not simply bouts of who is more powerful or who is more intelligent; yes, Wukong is more powerful than his enemies most of the time, but he prefers to use his ability to transform into anything and deception to play with his enemies (monkeying around, if you will), making for some really fun sequences. As a result, it doesn't have to rely on power levels to get viewers invested in the fights, and each fight is unique and creative.It's really hard to describe (and that's a good thing) so it's best you look up clips on Youtube to see what I mean. For now, I'll give an example. In one episode, it seems Wukong has finally met his match in Erlang Shen. In most series where two rivals fight, they try to hype it up with insane feats of power from both characters (Oh my god, they're both moving so fast we can't see them! Woah, he's so strong! Wow, I can't believe how he predicted that move!). Here, Wukong and Erlang Shen do compete to see who can grow the biggest, but then they both reach their limits and they start arguing about who should grow smaller first. Later, Wukong tries to flee so he turns into a sparrow, so Erlang Shen turns into a raven to chase him. In turn, Wukong turns into a hawk and chases Erlang Shen, who then turns into a condor, etc, etc.In general, the villains are also charmingly villainous. Most of the time, they'll just be demons doing demon things, saying ""We'll eat Tripitaka and gain immortality!"" and they'll sound cute and diabolical at the same time. Objectively, many of the villains are repetitive, just like how in this 52 episode series some of the episodes may start to feel boring and drag due to the lack of much of an overarching plot and sparse character development. Still, the decent stories and villains are well distributed throughout the series. The fact that each of the villains are defeated in a different way, often requiring Wukong to come up with a creative solution, especially helps reduce the wear from the episodic story structure. However, it is also clear that Wukong is too overpowered for the story's good and some episodes will depower him to create conflict and use deus ex machinas to defeat the villain. Another thing to note is that though this series is supposedly for children, there is an ample amount of violence. Wukong has no problem killing his enemies with a big thump of his Ruyi Jingu Bang (and the show makes it clear people are dead), in case you're worried the action is too childish.Even though I did say that there aren't any deep characters, Sun Wukong is still a great lead character unlike any other whose charisma keeps him interesting all 52 episodes. Zhu Bajie (Piggsy) is one of the best comedic characters out there, whose lovable lust, gluttony, and selfishness rivals Sun Wukong's lovable mischievousness, cleverness, and rebelliousness. Sandy's just there most of the time to play the straight man and is pretty weak in a battle unless it's in the sea. Tripitaka is the damsel in most of the episodes and often comes off as pious and self-righteous, making Sun Wukong's devotion to him somewhat unbelievable. And yet, the bond between teacher and student does provide for some emotional moments throughout the show, bolstered by the great soundtrack.From a technical standpoint, Xi You Ji might not be anything special compared to anime from the same time period, but it should be noted that the Chinese animation industry was crippled for decades by communist censorship and what Xi You Ji has achieved in spite of that should be given high praise. The backgrounds are beautifully drawn and the art is shows a unique Chinese touch without leaning on the style of the much more mature anime industry. As I said, the music is exceptional as well. The opening song tells of the legend of Wukong with powerful dignity, conveyed by a vigorous male voice that puts most generic rock OP's to utter shame, while the ending is a catchy children's choir song.Not only is Xi You Ji a significant cultural work drawing on the last remaining vestiges of Chinese civilization that have escaped communist depravity, but it is the best kind of children's story- the kind that will make you rediscover and cherish our youthful monkey nature.";Recommended

I have watched in both Cantonese and Mandarin, I can speak both. Cantonese is the best dub for me, best voices and the language-based humor of the script is off the roof. The show is cool and kickass, it's got amazing art. I find this Sun Wukong is the most handsome/sexy Monkey King in all Journey to the West adaptations.Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie are both big trolls. Jade Emperor is a funny habitual liar troll too. Ever since Sun Wukong crashed his court 500 years ago for his injustice, he still don't do the right stuff. He ostracizes Sun Wukong, acting like the too good for you calm prick god he is, and then he's here when Sun Wukong holds him to his responsibilities. He is really scared of the destruction Sun Wukong causes. I like the literature, it shows the deities above or below are also flawed or imperfect.Sun Wukong is close to a deity himself, The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal 齐天大圣, Zhu Bajie himself was once a Heavenly Navy General of 80,000 Heavenly Soldiers 天篷元帅 banished into a pig, and Sha Wujing the 3rd disciple another banished Heavenly General 卷帘大将. For redemption of punishment, their powers are used on a pilgrimage to the west to protect the monk Tang Sanzang (from evil demons that want to cook and eat his flesh for immortality) to bring back Buddhist scriptures.The long journey to be completed on foot is a sacred test observed by Buddha to see if they can overcome the many trials and if their wisdom for it is seeked, aided by the Bodhisattva powers to cast off evil. Faithful and so fun to watch adaptation of the classic Journey to the West literature.;Recommended
3;Xi You Ji;Skyregalia01;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skyregalia01;9;"Disclaimer: This review will be based on my memories as a child when I was watching the Chinese dub version of the show. Also, I watched this without any English subtitles and I did not watch an English dubbed version.Considering this was an adaptation to one of the four greatest Chinese literature (Journey to the West) it did an outstanding job to make it accessible for a young audience (i.e. children) to watch and enjoy the show. I remember watching this and always enjoyed the fight scenes and the magic (fa shu) used by the characters in the animation.Story-wise I believe most of the characters are present (if you exclude the main gang: Sun Wu Kong (monkey), Zhu Ba Jie (Pigsy), Sha He Shang (Sandy), and Tang San Zang (Tripitaka)) to give a coherent story from beginning to end on how the Journey to the West came about. Although considering the style of the show has the ""monster of the week"" trope and there are 52 episodes altogether it might not add up to the total tribulations that Tripitaka has to overcome. However, it is enough to keep you entertained in terms of character development and the dynamic between the three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Underworld. I will add that there is some simplicity in the story where you can say ""Isn't it just good guys beat bad guys?"" and I will say yes it does feel like that but for a young audience it does make sense. If you are interested in each of these ""monsters"" and want to understand why they became the way they are then it may be better to read the original literature and read from there.Art and Sound are impressive considering it was from the late 90's that it was produced. Of course, it will not compare to current animation production but at the time it was good enough to get you hooked into the series especially the many fight scenes present.Characters are very enjoyable and unique in their own way - though, considering the tribulations had to be unique it makes sense. There is the repeat of saving the monk or helping a stranger since their close friend/relative was kidnapped scenarios but the way the characters resolve each one and the reasons why these mishaps happened are unique in their own way. Moreover, the series does it quite well to show the impacts of one character's actions (in one episode) do have consequences, in the long run (like 5 episodes or more), where it will come back to bite them.Overall, this is a very enjoyable show that simplifies the story of Journey to the West in a well and understood story. A simple beginning, middle and end with little to no complications that could confuse the story. (I might be biased here considering that I am doing it from memory rather than actually rewatching the whole thing).SIDE NOTE: Remember this was meant for a young audience to watch so the language used will be very basic with little complications. Therefore, they will not go into too much world-building nor would they try to explain all the mechanics for using magic (fa shu) that the characters used. So if you were hoping for a deeper, in-lore about the ancient gods and the reason why they act as they do then you may need to do a little bit of research yourself (or watch some Chinese tv dramas) to get this information.";Recommended
0;Heya/Keitai;lavratti;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lavratti;8;"I found this anime through the 'Thinking and Drawing - Nihon no Shinseiki Art Animation' and therefore, already expected something artsy from the show, but this short anime was frankly quite good.The art, animation and sound were superb, very well arranged together and made the 7 minutes very entertaining. The way the music blended in was specially well done.I cannot recommend this to every one though, as this is very artsy and may not be that amusing compared to many other anime out there.Now to the personal interpretation corner:First let me note that the Japanese name ""部屋／形態"" means literally ""Room/Morph"" which I interpreted as ""Morphing room""Through the short, it felt like the paint on the wall was not only a reflection of the window, but represented how a story gets told. The development of the story told by the projections on the walls were tainted when passed though the windows and therefore acquired unique traits, represented by the shadow of the wooden part, interring the projections of the story being told. The sudden appearance of colors may as well represent how we perceive memories as good, bad, pleasant and unpleasant.Interpreting the show was more than half the fun, Id' recommend you do it too! :)";Recommended

A roller coaster of emotions was released on to me. Hitting me hard like a truck for 2 minutes of my life. The aftermath was of pure bliss, which nothing can be compared to. Tears were running down my face which I did not realize until I was brought back into reality. Confused and aroused, I collected my thoughts and focused up.

Southpaw is one of those cases.An absolute madlass of a director and animator Kabuki Sawako with her surreal, sometimes distasteful and yet still amusing animations together with Kuricorder Quartet, a folk band with specific sound. Those two elements compliment each other perfectly, like salt an pepper, like knife and fork, like cheese and wine, like pineapple and pizza. I usually treat ""quirky"" as a pretentious buzzword, but in this instance is the perfect adjective to use. Colorful, playful and weird. Weird in a very entertaining way.In fact, right after I watched Southpaw for the first time, I just had to rewatch it. And again. And again. How much anime can boast attention magnet this strong? Not to mention, that rewatching Southpaws does in fact have value besides just being entertained again. There's just so much characters that you can focus on just part of the screen and watch what exactly are those small figures doing in the background, which you haven't noticed the first time.I am not afraid to call Southpaw a work of art and I feel truly blessed that I exist in the same sphere of reality as this little gem.";Recommended

I can only call things because I am not sure what they are, but with the heads of those things, it looks completely hand drawn, in fact I believe it is completely hand drawn so well too. While being baked I felt completely entranced by the colors and movement of each thing. The sound was aight at best, with it sounding like a 3rd graders first recorder.

0;Nogsaegjeoncha Hamos;danielastellar;https://myanimelist.net/profile/danielastellar;10;Since I was very young I had a great amount of cartoons and anime I had enjoyed but no other anime, or to be more precise- a manhwa, has ever had such impact on me as a child. I had watched all of it from the start to finish for at least five times and it broke my heart to find out that the Kanal D, the broadcaster for the tiny country of Serbia, where I was watching it was shut down. But looking back at it, I am ultimately shocked at how great and underrated this show is- how is it possible that this is not at least fansubbed in English?!Story- 10/10Story of the Hamos The Green Chariot starts fairly simple, by giving you the introduction to the planet of Terra who saw much tragedy and pain, then it introduces you to the crew of the Hamos, probably the coolest tank I had seen, ever, who are about to embark on a journey to pay the bills for the orphanage by finding the seven crystals. The story adds layer upon layer as it progresses toward the epic tale of saving the Terra, and it becomes sometimes even surprisingly dark for something marketed towards children and has a fantastic coming of age touch to it and fills you with hope. It can be dismissed as a typical save-the-world kind of story, which, depending on your perspective, it can be, but the way it is told with convincing and humanistic characters is fantastic and it really makes you cheer for the cast! My only problem with it is that some parts of it are rather cheesy- like very, very cheesy, but these moments are brief and it had not distracted me from the epic tale it is telling.The story almost fundamentally changes from episode 10 when the mecha element is introduced- Rick gets his own robot, the Patron, which looks fantastic and is memorable.Art- 10/10Hamos' art style is fantastic- the landscapes and the scenery is extremely diverse, ranging from barren deserts to megacities. Character designs are great and are very distinctive- Rick's character's design is probably one of the most distinctive designs I had seen in animation and Gutpo is the best robot ever- because he has a robotic mustache! The design of the chariot (the thank) itself is very cool, very memorable. I think that the art's major strength is its diversity, as mentioned before, in landscapes to the character designs. Mecha designs are very memorable and the scene of Rick entering the patron is in my opinion, iconic.Animation 10/10Animation is highly detailed, has a weight to it and is very expressive. Action scenes stand out as one of the finest from the 90s and the character animation outside from action is also fantastic. There wasn't a moment when it felt badly animated.Sound- 10/10The original Korean opening theme 'Rick's Theme' sung by Girl is beyond fantastic- even without knowing the lyrics it conveys a fantastic sense of emotion and is extremely hopefully, like it is telling you 'Have faith in the Earth, the shining tomorrow shall bring you hope!' and it is used even as a background music, and every time it is used, it creates a magnificent blend with the scene and makes it even more memorable. Other music is also great- for example, Mary Hunter's theme is excellent, appears at the right time and feels appropriate. Other music is slightly less memorable, but it gets the job done. Sound effects stand between great and ok, but they serve their purpose. Japanese intro theme 'Looking for the Rainbow' by Humming Bird is OK, and interestingly, the Serbian opening sequence is actually using the instrumental of this rather then of the original 'Rick's theme'! Serbian opening theme is good, but it has some childish lyrics (example: 'from the one side there are villains and from the other brave kids' (?!)). Ending Korean theme is good, but disappointing compared to the opening. In Serbian dub, opening theme is re used as the ending theme.Voice acting- 10/10Serbian dub is pretty good, considering that it was done by complete amateurs, with some exceptions, which are some villains- the hologram scene at the end of the first episode is an example of this- the laughter there is very, very cringe-worthy... Rick's actor is great, so is Gutpo's and Bora's- who sounds a lot like Rei Ayanami to me. Only issue is the pronunciation of Gutpo's name- in Serbian dub they call him 'Gotpo', which is incorrect if you compare it to the way he is called in the Korean version. Overall a good, but ultimately a mixed bag. I can't speak to much for Korean since I haven't listened to much of Korean voice acting, and I can't speak for the Japanese side of things since I can't find the Japanese version anywhere.Characters 10/10If you haven't understood yet, I love the cast- they all have human feeling to them and are a very fun characters to watch, especially Hamos' crew. Rick is a great main character, has a childish side to him, which makes him a fun character to watch, Gutpo is a great supporting figure to the rest of the crew and acts as a voice of reason and has a interesting past. Bora is a mystery at the beginning and reminds me of that particular girl with blue hair and red eyes but gets a substantial depth to her character as show progresses. Villains, starting with the main ones, Chuck and Nero are actually great and have motivation for their actions and don't appear as evil as it seems at the beginning. Chuck (I think that's how you write it in English?) is a particular example of this as his character gets a surprising twist by the end of the show and makes him one of the best characters. Nero is good and also has some depth. Other characters include Merry Hunter, great sidekick who also has a revelation. Only miss is Roto, who ends up looking childish and useless most of the time but he is great for comedic moments.Enjoyment- 10/10I had a great time with every single minute of it. I loved the action, character interactions, mystery and development of characters. Show has a great sense of adventure and mysticism.Overall- 10/10One of the most shockingly underrated shows ever- truly a shining emerald everyone had forgotten about, but in the hearts of the few, you will be remembered forever, as you head into the desert sunset, Hamos the Green Chariot.;Recommended

Seeing the sharp contrast between each story is what makes the OVA so consistently fresh and engaging.Episode 2 is completely nonsensical in a hypnotizing sort of way. Episodes 4 and 6 are surreal and mind-melting, yet intensely captivating and mesmerizing. And episodes 5 and 9 are genuinely creepy in a way that only alternative media like this can convey.

Such as the first villain's connection to the the other main villain. While i don't think it was made clear one was sent out to build a force for the other to conquer with. Aside from that the story was a delightful romantic tale with some tossed in drama. As for the ending a true fairy tale ending.ArtThis movie has come a long way. It used to be painted in such a dark fashion. Like a dream which makes sense given plot. But more of a dream where one would recall bits and peaces. For depending what version you had that is all you saw. Luckily there is a brighter more refined detailed version(which is what i saw). However, there were some dark areas but a real remarkable difference compared to the vch version.Although one element that was somewhat featured in the show was the portrayal of a real life ballerina. Not quite sure aside from innocence that had with the story.Overall: If you are a parent and wish to present a young girl a memorable tale to ponder as she drifts off to sleep i would suggest this. While sure it does have a certain England feel to it but the happy message comes out clear.Love conquers all. With the added bonus of possibly encouraging a proper follow through with bedtime hours.;Mixed Feelings
0;1/100 Train Station;maartens31;https://myanimelist.net/profile/maartens31;7;There is basically no story in the two-minute clip that is 1/100 Train Station. Also, it's devoid of sound. However, it doesn't need any of that, since it's main point of interest is likely the visuals.The animation in this clip consists of stop-motion, and therefore it doesn't look like a typical anime. This doesn't mean it has no good visuals. A lot of work has been put in, by including as many paper characters as possible and making them all move, so that it resembles an actual, fastforwarded day in a train station. On top of that, it includes a X-ray moment where you can see through part of the train. Because of all this, it becomes somewhat engaging to watch. And in shorts like these, this will usually do.Funny thing: there is a short segment in the video in which the 'characters' are introduced.I do not regret watching this. Besides, it's kinda fun to watch an anime that is mostly unknown as an anime.It's hard to give this one an actual score, since it doesn't feel like something with a lot of meat to it, being just a very small clip. I'll go with a 7, since it's kinda fun, but probably not something you'll recommend to a lot of people.;Recommended
0;Batain Lai!! Minami no Shima no Mizu Monogatari;eyerok;https://myanimelist.net/profile/eyerok;7;"This review is dedicated to Noboru Ishiguro, the legendary director of SDF Macross, Megazone 23, Legend of Galactic heroes, and the founder of Artland, the studio responsible for modern hits such as Mushishi and Katekyo Hitman REBORN!!, who died of lung infection last year in March 2012 at the age of 73. 'Pattenrai!! Minami no Shima no Mizu Monogatari' (or 'Yoichi Hatta - the father of Chianan Canal') was his last directorial work.‘Pattenrai!!’ is based on the true story of Yoichi Hatta, a Japanese civil engineer who designed the Chianan Canal and Wushantou Reservoir in Japanese occupied Taiwan before the second World War, changing the barren southern region into one of Taiwan's most fertile lands.The story is told through the perspectives of two friends, A-Wen and Chin-yi , who grow up during the years that the canal is constructed, and shows how each of their lives are affected, directly or indirectly, by Yoichi Hatta and the Chianan Canal project. ‘A-Wen’ is the son of a poor Taiwanese farmer in Chianan, who at first shares his father’s mistrust of Hatta and his project, but is later inspired by Hatta to become a civil engineer and take part in his project. ‘Chin-yi’ is the son of a Japanese who works for Construction and Forest Agency but later joins Yoichi Hatta’s Canal project as an engineer.The movie roughly covers the years that it took to construct the canal, from 1917 to 1930, following the construction of the project and the effect that it has on the people of the region, and especially these two friends. The story of these two kids adds a flavor of slice of life to the historical period drama.There are some who say that Pattenrai!! is at least borderline propaganda material, meant to promote the now archaic Japanese nationalist sentiments. They say or suggest this because of the history between the two countries and their mutual mistrust, which is present (to some extent) till this day in the current south china sea dispute. A review I read on the internet points out how odd it is that a Japanese production would be made to pay tribute to the Japanese Engineer, when in fact he is more of Taiwan’s hero and lived most of his life there in Taiwan with his family. However, nothing in the movie suggests that there is any propaganda material, and it seems that the movie was made with all the best intentions.The movie does not criticize nor glorify imperial Japan, or expose the evils that Japanese committed in Taiwan; that is not the intent. It is not a realistic period drama that covers these political aspects. Instead it emphasizes on putting aside all differences and working for the improvement of human beings through science, technology, hard work, and sheer will-power. Yoichi Hatta of the movie believes strongly in his project and the changes it will bring. At one point, A-Wen asks him why he is doing something that will help the people of the land when he is not Taiwanese, and he replies that it does not matter where he comes from, the sea and the water are the heritage of all mankind.After digging up on the internet, I found out that the movie was used as part of an effort to get Chianan Canal and Wushantou reservoir recognized as world heritage sites. It created some buzz in Taiwan when it was given special screenings attended by political figures, including president and former president of Taiwan. This was eventually followed by the inauguration of the Yoichi Hatta Memorial Park on 8 May 2011 near Wushantou reservoir in Tainan city, on the 69th anniversary of the passing of Yoichi Hatta. The history of the canal and its designer especially after WWII makes for an interesting read and is worth checking out.The best part of Pattenrai!! is the ending, when the canal is finally completed and the water starts flowing through the barren and arid lands. After the end, as the credits roll, we are led through the events that follow, including the tragic death of Yoichi Hatta and his wife during the second world war, and how they are still remembered and honored in Taiwan till this day.Pattenrai!! is a low budget project that is doomed to be unpopular, and not without good reason. Its style and content make it unsuitable for mass audience, and it will only appeal to anime fans who like realistic historical drama. Its animation is mediocre at best. Its music is nothing to write home about, and It is far from masterpiece material. It is not anything spectacular or moving, and some may even find it dull or boring. Its plot has not been ‘realistically’ executed in the sense that you would expect in a live action movie, but has been adopted with anime specific ethos and sensibilities. One might say that the content of the movie would have been more suitable for live action or even a documentary, but I suppose animation is a more cheaper and ‘safer’ option considering the purpose of the movie. But it is a decent movie all the same, one that is worth checking out by those who are interested in historical drama.";Recommended

Absolutely everything about it was top-notch, and I could not recommend it more. The storyline was simply so compelling that it brought me to tears. The artwork and stop motion animation was perfect, capturing every frame in the absolute best way possible. The sounds of the movie were serenading my ears throughout the entire film. It was as if I had died and been reborn with every little squeak, every little effect, every single sound caressing my ear canals. The characters, as well as their development was second to none. Every character that was introduced brought a new and compelling feature to the movie. Just when you thought they had every character archetype, a new one appears, in greater fashion than you could have ever imagined. The sheer enjoyment knowing that I was one of the lucky souls blessed enough to find this anime is enough to fulfill every life dream and aspiration I have ever had. Pui Pui Molcar completed my life. It completed me. Pui Pui Molcar is the single greatest series to ever exist, and the movie still found a way to make it better. I could not imagine a more perfect ending to an already perfect series. If you have not watched this, I promise you it will change you. If you have a loved one who is suffering, this movie alone will cure them of all their pains. If you are struggling to get out of bed every single morning, Pui Pui Molcar will be the reason why you continue. It revived my soul;Recommended
0;Kuro ga Ita Natsu;Gay4Pay;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gay4Pay;6;From Nakazawa Keiji, the creator of Hadashi no Gen (Barefoot Gen) and Kuroi Ame ni Utarete (Beaten by the Black Rain). Kuro ga Ita Natsu (Summer with Kuro) aired in June of 1990, making it the last movie made by GEN Productions. It’s a strange movie to end on. Summer with Kuro is a simplistic movie that I can safely assume is targeted at younger kids. This one isn't as impactful or memorable, which is probably why hardly anyone has seen it.Summary (spoilers!):In the summer of 1945, a schoolgirl named Nobuko saves a malnourished kitten from being eaten by crows. She takes the kitten home, but her parents don't want her to keep it. After sneaking the kitten back in the house, being discovered, and running away with the kitten, Nobuko manages to convince her parents to allow her to keep the kitten. Nobuko and her brother name it Kuro. Nobuko catches fish for Kuro to eat and plays with Kuro frequently. The cat grows & becomes stronger. It eventually becomes cat-Jesus. Kuro saves Nobuko's life on several occasions and sacrifices himself so that she may survive the Hiroshima atom-bombing. You may think I’m joking, but I’m not. That actually happens. After Kuro saves Nobuko, he dies in a bomb shelter. It’s very sad. Considering her cat and her house were the only losses, I’d say Nobuko made it out of Hiroshima in fairly good condition.Final thoughts:Silly? Yes. It's very silly. Parts of it are quite endearing, as well. It’s similar to Hadashi no Gen in the sense that the tone can jump from cute and whimsical to terrifying & sad in the span of a few seconds. Unlike Hadashi no Gen this movie isn’t semi-biographical in nature, so the tone shifts feel a little clumsy. Hadashi no Gen, its sequel, and Kuroi Ame ni Utarete are all interesting, relevant, and worth watching if you’re interested in Hiroshima pieces, but you can skip Kuro ga Ita Natsu. Of all the anime released by GEN Productions, this one is the strangest. Why did Nakazawa Keiji feel the need to adapt this story to film? I don’t know, it’s a very ill-fitting choice. I wouldn’t call it a waste of time, just time better spent watching more culturally and/or historically relevant pieces.;Mixed Feelings

0;Self-Portrait;spiralalchemy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/spiralalchemy;5;Self portrait is a simple short film. Its definitely not something you will regret seeing, but it doesn't really leave much of an impact. The story is simple, a sculptor creates a demon that comes to life and the demon attempts to become the creator by sculpting the creator. That is really it, no real characterization or story (granted it is a short film).On the other hand the stop motion animation looks great. As someone who tried stop motion animation and knows at least what goes into it, it was great seeing a complex piece of art . Its also rare to see stop motion animation and actually seeing it is rather cool (even if it is rather old). The music itself is okay sets the mood I guess.Overall, its a decent piece of animation that hopefully you will not regret seeing if you do decide to see it.;Mixed Feelings

0;Ashinaga Ojisan;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;5;"Based on a novel written a hundred years ago, about a young orphan girl who gets the chance to go to college by a mysterious benefactor, with the stipulation that she write him at least one letter each month.To be honest, I was completely unfamiliar with the literary work, so I was going in to this short movie as if it was its own stand-alone work. At its heart, it's a ""feel-good"" story about a young girl who has a happy college life without many conflicts and ends up living happily ever after. As such, it can get pretty saccharine in parts, as she experiences the life of a high-society girl, coming from her humble origins.Given that this is under an hour long, and it is adapting a longer literary work, of course you can tell there are parts that are cut out, and not covered in any detail. There are hints of a love rivalry that are never fleshed out, and her simple life in the orphanage is barely a few minutes at the start.The artwork is fairly unsophisticated (even for the time it was produced, forty years ago), and the animation is similarly unimpressive.

1;Ashinaga Ojisan;NewAnimeFan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NewAnimeFan;5;"I'm not sure if it was the awful English dub, the horrible animation, or the over sentimentality of the story that made this so painful to watch.

The art was so bad, I know it was made 1979, but I've seen pretty decent animation from that decade. Know the sentiment, ugh, I just wanted to punch Judy and most of the other characters.This TV special was based on the 1912 novel, ""Daddy-Long-Legs"" by Jean Webster. It follows most of the main points of story (which I must admit is better than any of the live-action versions I've seen), while also somehow barely resembling it.

If you're a Ryu Knight fan, it is probably okay to pick it up.StoryThe story mostly surrounds a mysterious woman, Ryu Knight, and the Dial of Destruction. Compared to the first Adeu Legend, I thought ALII had a more interesting storyline, and definately shows the ""alternative retelling"" aspect of the OVAs. But because the series is short, I think some potential was lost.ArtKeeps with the ""OVA style"" like from the first one. There seems to be more shade. Apparently, some years have passed because Adeu and Paffy look a bit older, especially Adeu. I love Adeu's look. He really looks strong and heroic now. Ryu Knight looks cool with the shoulder emblems from AL I. BUT! The Ryu doesn't have the impressive ""summon"" scenes like from the TV series. Ryu Knight's first summon in this OVA looked pretty good, but it's downhill after that. Plus, I wish the fighting was a bit more better animated.SoundHaha, the main cast is like from the first OVA, a few of them having different roles. Takehito Koyasu, Hiro Yuuki, Juurouta Kosugi, Ai Orikasa, Akiko Yajima, and Tomohiro Nishimura is a fine cast from the 90s. Koyasu (Ikazeus from AL1) plays the main villain this time, the power-hungry and cold Dyuma. Ai (Hyunto) is Dyuma's pretty and loyal right-hand servant, Ron. Sakiko Tamagawa (Malto) is the calm-but-hurting-inside Sophie. When it comes to sound-effect, nothing in particular seems bad.CharacterThere are a few changes with the four main characters. Let's just say that a wandering killer happens to coincidently look and behave like an old friend, and the heroine runs into a look-a-like. Adeu seems more mature, but still the lovable reckless knight of justice. Paffy also seemed more matrue and strong.EnjoymentFew episodes so there's little fighting.

0;Ochou Fujin no Gensou;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;6;"Ochou Fujin no Gensou is a literal interpretation of the Operatic performance by Giacomo Puccini, which in itself is based on a French novel ""Madame Chrysanthemum"" aka Madam Butterfly. The book shaped a lot of Western attitudes towards Japan and is considered a seminal work of western literature involving aspects of Japanese culture. The animated work in itself is a very surface level adaptation of the story beats with a more Japanese interpretation and is much less sympathetic to the Naval officer than the original novel. In a way it even works as a propaganda film, but mostly the work is pretty seminal for its technical innovation - it was the first Japanese film to feature silhouette animation. The pacing is all over the place and you can clearly recognize that the animators were still struggling to envision how the style would evolve. These were days of experimentation, innovation and discovery in the animated artform and cinema in general. I'd say it is worth a watch if only for its historical significance, but it isn't the best that silhouette style animation of the era has on offer.";Mixed Feelings

When you are inviting someone to somewhere and it being done in movement form don't you want to make sure they know the 'w':who, what, where.... while you have their attention?

1;Count Down;Eoussama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eoussama;3;This is some sort of promotional animation of the exhibition “ArtPatrh 2011”, no matter how I would look at it, it doesn't stand for a one-shot storytelling of any sort, just made for some blunt publication, one other note tho, in the information section of this short, it says that it's suitable for all ages, but no, it has some significant adult content spaning for several frames, we're talking NSFW materials.- Story (3/10):The story, well, where is it to begin with? we could sit here all day and analyze this frame by frame and it would be a very vague panoramical experience, for instance, the camera moves across what it looks like a crowd of people on a very stereotypical house party, you get to see a lot of background characters interacting like normal people at a teenage party would, you got you sneaky couple exchanging kisses, people bathing in beer, you really get to see their amusement, and how energetic they are.In the meanwhile, the crowd seems to be counting down from ten, -hence the name of the animation- which of course again, referring to the ArtPath 2011 exhibit.- Art (6.0/10):Nothing more than random silhouettes of a crowd partying, but I really enjoy those transitions, no color spread or anything, but you still get what's going on in the screen, it really helps your imagination to auto-colorize the blank parts, which then again, is the state of the whole canvas.- Story (3/10):There is the stereotypical jazz background music going on, with some ambient sound effects while the camera moves around, it really felt short on the voice acting tho, you can easily notice how fewer people are screaming the countdown are compared to the ones shown partying, felt so out of sync for me at least.- Character (2.0/10):There is no focus on a single entity whatsoever, but rather, the whole cast is regarded as one entity, probably it's the cameraman, who knows.- Enjoyment (3.0/10):I didn't really feel like anything innovative, being shorter than your typical Youtube ads even, the time feels even faster than a normal 36 seconds would, but times goes by anyways right?- Overall (3.6/10):I wouldn't recommend this for anyone, or else they will think I'm some kind of weirdo idolizing this type of animations, I would probably have this long forgotten in minutes to come, so it really isn't something to brag about, well, should you watch it?

Or, given too much unwanted attention if pretty.Which, in turn leads them to worry about people. Worrying about people is not really a bad thing unless you see it the way i do. Since most women will be mothers nature decided to award them with divine care to others feelings so despite how much the baby pisses them off they will still love the child. Now, take what they have been given and apply it to their romantic life. starting to put it together? No? okay, fine i will be a little more detailed.... but not much i don't want you to say i spoiled the underlining message for you. Think about how women feel on their weight vs men.

0;Kappo;NinjaMike28;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NinjaMike28;2;I think 'abstract' is the best way to describe this so called 'movie'.If you read the synopsis and look at the picture - what you see is literally what you get.To refine it into further detail: legs are dawdling about on the screen - setting up many ways to... wear the shoes, walk on the shoes and dance on the shoes. To add more excitement - an accordion is playing in the background in harmonious synchrony while the legs are doing its business with the shoes. Yeah...So suffice to say, this 'movie' is... a time waster... that's the honest truth... Even as a skit on youtube it'll be something that you'll watch for the first 10 seconds before disregarding it as another shit video.If you have a foot fetish... you might like it? I don't want to guarantee anything since it'll probably be a massive let down with its close to zero animation detail - you might as well watch grass grow (seriously).It's art... and it was in the anime section so I watched it - only to realise I wasted 4 minutes of my life... 'Mars of Destruction' is 'The Godfather' compared to this....So yeah... for the love of God, 'try' not to waste your time like I did. And if you do go watch it... Shame on you...;Not Recommended
0;K×Drop!!;Rumni;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rumni;6;Spoilers Beware:Sound: I approve of the choice of music, uproarious bangs add suspense to the situation. There are realistic sounds of objects breaking and directional cues of audio.Overall a 6 to keep you on the edge of your seatArt: The landscape of the mall seems to be appealing to the eye, with the way light reflects on objects and looks bright in a night setting. The shadows of dark rooms do make it hard to see. I also like the art style the way the characters are drawn. It reminds me of how characters are drawn in Kill la Kill. The score is a 7.5, but I'll round it to an 8.Character: Endo runs around the mall and is freaked out easily. The score is a 4Story: Endo, the security guard, chased an unknown intruder in the mall(public property) he works at later to find out it was a cat. He accidentally punched his partner in a panic, thinking the person behind the door is the culprit of the chaos. But it is revealed there is actually someone in hiding. Nothing out of the ordinary. My score is a 5My final score is a 6 considering this a self-independent animation and is fine for 5 minutes.;Mixed Feelings
0;Baby Baachan;deep3anime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/deep3anime;8;I saw it 12 years ago when it was telecast-ed in my country India. I heard about the wisdom behind our old generation through the techniques delivered by my grand mother and some elders. But watching this anime made me learn more about such techniques that are useful for daily chores. I felt ignorant and was happy to learn something useful through an anime.Coming to the story, at first i can sympathise myself with the protagonist Amika. But at the same time i wished there could be a little sister like the baby baa-chan. But as the series progressed, i started to admire her grandmother ( before she died) . In my view she did manage an island where she had to live in isolation but still she chose to stand for the creatures of the island. Amika's character represented well the mind-set of every teenage girl. The writer seems to have good observation skills. But Amika's personality changes by the end of the series.I recommend any girl who is self-oriented and sad that her wishes are not fulfiiled by her parents and grand-parents are a head-ache. By watching this this kind of girls could start love their grand parents. I wish there were more 'family oriented' anime like this one.;Recommended

If it is because nobody bothers to watch them, it would be pretty sad, because it´s quite imposing how an abstract little work of art is perceived as something amazing by some people, while others simply ask themselves what the hell they just watched.If you haven´t watched anything like this before, give it a try and see what Ryu Kato does to you. The worst thing that can happen is that you feel like you wasted a few minutes of your time.While this, well..., ""review"" can be seen as a review to all of his works, i chose to write it in ""Recorder"", because it´s my favourite artwork from Kato.";Mixed Feelings

Sadly for me i wont because i know you readers are confused so i will explain, sigh.Subject of focus Art:Art was terrible. You have what looks like a constant loop (animation) for the 'major scene'. No need for fixing your tv/monitor it is blurry. No blurry in hentai censorship for like fuzzy as in this is why i love h.d. television. Characters were not fully drawn in. Almost as if the artists said here kids do my color job for me. Granted that style was probably done to enhance the animation but it failed poorly.Now, how about that plot?*slaps writer!* Yes, starting with something of action can be a useful tatic but you must explain why! yes, one can do a basic report. Then again so can i why i get to work. For example: ""hey ____, thanks for coming in. We really needed you."" My response in terms of how the animation played out in the film ""hi"". Diagnosis i could have elaborated much more. which would have made for a more interesting read. Oh well...p.s. as for the plot? haha! sure, i will tell you my take on that. you see ____, the one thing ___ did not like about ___ ____ was ____ _ __ ___ _____ for it ___ ___ _ ___ _ __.

0;Enshou Nihon Mukashibanashi;2DHT;https://myanimelist.net/profile/2DHT;3;"The hentai Enshou Nihon Mukashibanashi is made up by three different short stories, therefore this review will be split into three parts when discussing the actual contents of each story.The art style used here is really reminiscent of Doraemon and other similar children's anime around that time. It adds to the hentai by giving it a different feel when watching it, like turning a children's anime into an adult one. This is to appeal to an audience which grew up watching these children's anime and uses nostalgia to its advantage.Story 1:This story follows a couple with a baby, where the man in the relationship cannot hold back his urges. I started feeling bad for the baby at first when he was just trying to get milk from his mother but his dad was getting in the way because he wanted to unleash his lust on the mother. However after that they started doing it in front of the baby while having it watch. Later on during the night the baby was sleeping and the dad started doing the mom again, this woke up the baby which made it into another situation where it was watching them. This time it got a little worse when the baby was riding the dad's shoulders while the dad was motorboating the mother.Story 2:Here we meet a lone man wandering around and stumbling upon three nuns. He is way too lustful to hold back and starts doing all the nuns, however the nuns are lustful as well so its hard for the man to keep up with them all. Also for some reason all the nuns are bald, I never knew that it was a thing.Story 3:There are some parts of this story being unclear due to there not being any subtitles. It takes place on a farm where there lives a farmer and a woman with him. I couldn't tell what the relation between the farmer and the woman was because of the lack of subtitles but its probably either his wife or his daughter, although living alone with his daughter would be less likely than him living alone with his wife. An ugly bastard comes by, and hangs out with the family, all goes well until the farmer starts doing the crops and the woman is in the house by herself. The ugly bastard comes in and starts doing her with his meat which is about the size of her whole body. The woman enjoyed it so much that it became something they did over and over. She even took small breaks to keep the farmer in check at the farm so she could have more time with the ugly bastard.The use of a nostalgic art style works really well for this hentai, however the stories doesn't hold up. The first story tries making having a baby watch an intercourse be the vocal point, but I don't see how having a baby watch is gonna make it hotter, it only ended up doing the opposite. The second story just ended up being a boring harem. And the third one was the only decent one because it played on the theme of ""trying not to get caught"" decently. Overall not too bad, but not recommended either.";Not Recommended
1;Enshou Nihon Mukashibanashi;HentaiSamaDesu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HentaiSamaDesu;2;Yeah, This was probably the most uncomfortable thing I've ever watched. I couldn't even get through it because in the first like 10 minutes, all they did was have sex in front of their kid, and even kept going when their kid was awake.Weirdly enough, this started with a live action sex scene? I couldn't find a copy with subtitles, so I don't really understand what's going on. This is bound to happen, since this hentai is so old, but it starts out with a farm couple working in a farm. Their son gets hungry so the mom decides to breast feed. The Dad get's hard and basically has sex with the mom right in front of the son. Shit was extremely uncomfortable to watch. Even when the son was awake and paying attention, they STILL kept going.I couldn't even finish it after that. I skipped a little and it seems like there is a nun sex scene too? I don't even know where to go with this. This was so uncomfortable to watch.;Not Recommended

Despite her young age, she strives for an independent lifestyle. She developed an unstable mentality as a result of a trauma in her early childhood, making it difficult for her to form bonds at school. Because of her bottled-up rage, she let it all out by running. Unaware of her talent as a runner, her PE discovered it and convinced her to compete in and win the 100m sprint race championship.As the story progresses, Hany is forced to confront her personal problems and fears, as well as make a decision with her family. Her teacher has an interesting backstory as well; he wants Hany to win the championship in order to settle a grudge from his past.The anime's pacing may be slow for some, but I recommend watching it all the way through because there is an interesting plot twist near the end.Run Hany is a classic Korean sport anime that I highly recommend watching.";Recommended
0;Hyakka Zukan;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;3;You know what this reminded me of? A senior project.As in, a student has majored in film at college, specializing in animation. As part of the student's senior project, they have to create a short film that incorporated ten different, distinct animation techniques.As a result, you end up with a hodge-podge mix of different styles, using all sorts of materials. The string that ties it all together is an English word, which an animated representation is shown. The last letter is then used to form the next word - rinse, lather, repeat.The problem is, there's absolutely no connection between one word to the next. It's as if they were pulled out of a hat at random. No theme runs through this, it just jumps from one short claymation animated bit, to puppets, to moving shapes, to whatever is next. No reason, no point.;Not Recommended

Not all story revolve around plot like I would prefer. There are gifs (if i am saying that correctly/not a teen) and other short marketing tools. If anyone has seen MTV they would know it is not a children station nor is it a adult only station. More of a station for males that are peaking in puberty. At least that is how it was when i grew up. Which is why i can understand them wanting something like this short animation for a trademark. Aside from stating the obvious ecchi perspective they are showing underlining comedy. Although, the comedy is more troll like than ha ha based. Ending kind of upset me. If you recall my male perking mention than you might know what i mean. Ending only hinted even more so that this is a show for males when there are some shows and music females could enjoy as well. Thus, having females depicted as objects doesn't help boost ratings for at least one side of genders.artI don't like how some of the art was recycled in a way.Overall: I would have like to give this a higher rating of a 4 but if i did i might be opening a door. If i considered this short as anime i would have to consider all other possible shorts as anime. Next thing you know we would have as many anime as manga.

0;Steady x Study;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;1;Idea Factory anime. You know these guys can be considered the best in showing how trash you can be on an animated production just for the sake of making some cash from their appalling OVAS and like that get a way to promote their crappy videogames.About the story I simply don't know what the hell did I just watch. The show is simply a waste of time and I mean this literally, the purpose of this OVA is to waste time because the story starts and 5 minutes in have passed and there is no freaking dialogue for a 24 minute runtime show. They just show the characters standing, some girl drinking juice, another girl going to write something on her notebook and a guy making a paper plane on the roof of the school. Later there is a meeting about the school budget for school clubs and some students get into a fight because some school clubs are not approved and when they are about to explain something they cut for an idiotic commercial pause when IT'S A FREAKING DVD NOT A BROADCAST FOR TV. Later there is a love confession and they love each other because reasons that I don't know or that only are explained in that crappy PS2 game which this OVA is based and they live happily forever...(?) Like I said its a freaking waste of time but what other Idea Factory anime isn't?The Animation Hoo Boy where do I even begin with these awful animation?The only good thing about this one is that at least there wasn't putrid CG they have constantly using but the 2D way they decided to use for this thing it is still garbage. They focus so much on those awful backgrounds that look like they were made in Flash and with hurry because the designs are simply dumb. The animation is so low that there is a scene that the singing club members are warming up their voices and the animation is so lame... wait a minute there is not even animation, what they do is put the mouth changing frames like when you passed a photo real quick and they just changed them the mouths don't move, they slap the freaking next mouth movement one after another. Also there is a freaking problem with the camera. The camera is always moving left and right and without reason. It seems that the animators couldn't bother in mantaining a stable animation frame and just move scene so they can't make the characters appear more.Sound is simply abhorrent. They put this highschool male and they decided to hire a girl voice for the guy and it sounds so off. The movement of the mouth also doesn't look great for what the characters are saying. They just move the mouth up and down without making any phonemes It's poop.And that's everything with it. There is nothing more like I said from 24 minutes only like 6 minutes is dialogue. This is not even a source of entertainment, it's a time drainer slapped on a DVD and decided to call it entertainment. Just wondering how the hell did Idea Factory survived this long when crap like that was around during their time on the early 2000s.;Not Recommended

Very little movement during H scenes and I don't like the character designs at all. KaraKara's clothes somehow make her look like a loli until she's naked and then she looks like a fully grown adult woman. Maybe that's her power. Shit, now I want her power... To look like a loli as long as I'm not naked... Anyway, it's not fluid animation and the gif scenes aren't enjoyable.Sound: I shit you not, the thrusting noises sound like one of those cups of squishy playdough that makes fart noises. It's not sexy at all and sounds like queefing the entire time. Gross. VA work is decent all around. Most of all, there is sufficient moaning. Yummy. But, there's nothing else tasty about this hentai.Character: Three fuckables, one guy. Main girl is a new god on the job who doesn't know how to be a god and thinks fucking the sacrifice (our main protag) is the best course of action. Later, two demons appear and fuck him while the KaraKara is asleep or some shit.Story: MC is a sacrifice to the gods, god fucks him, he takes her home (isn't that a problem for the area which worships that shrine?), demons show up, everyone gets fucked. The end.Overall: I don't recommend it. It has nothing going for it except moans. And I can just record myself moaning if that's all I wanted. I did get off to it, but only because moans.

Maybe because it's essentially impossible to jack off to this hentai, but who knows.Story: Papa is badass. Papa cuts pervert dick off. Papa chef. Papa make dick soup. (I think, anyway) End of story. Also, Papa has M4.Art: It's shit. Papa has a very manly and inspirational face though. So what if it's bad, weebs don't actually care about animation quality, or One-Punch Man S2 wouldn't be rated as high as it is. Also, can't say anything about H scenes since there aren't any lololol (except like a 10-second sex scene where Papa releases his fill *smirk*)Sound: Papa is voiced by ya boi Shigeru so you know it's good. I think the VA work is pretty good overall. Music is meh. Sound effects are insanely good, when Papa fired his M4 I actually felt like I was in Vietnam.Character: Hands down Papa is Daddy. A hero who fights for women's rights and protects their chastity by cutting dicks off of perverts. Truly admirable. His partner who poses as the vulnerable virgin *insert whatever her name was* is very brave and determined to help Papa in his attack on sexual assault. Their belief in one another and partnership is showcased wonderfully in the hentai.Enjoyment: High.

0;Kyuukyoku no Chef wa Oishinbo Papa;PoisonBang;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PoisonBang;4;"Kyuukyoku no Chef wa Oishinbo Papa is an unprecedented mess of a production, but that's what also makes it one of the funniest goddamn things I've seen. It's a comedy by design, but not a particularly funny one, the primary source of laughs comes from the baffling production. The film's absolutely littered with tiny animation mistakes and completely missing textures, perhaps only made funnier by how easy most of them would've been to fix, had anyone given a fuck.The film follows a man and a young woman, who run a restaurant by day, and hunt sex offenders by night, figuratively speaking anyway. The main characters are easy to mistake as a father and daughter, what with the whole ""papa"" thing, but they're not. The film's labeled as a hentai, but you'd really have to be a next level prude to consider it more than an erotic comedy; it barely features any sex, and what little of it there is, is hardly titillating to any but those most sexually deprived of civilized society. I mean however it is that Myanimelists rating system works, it's rated R+ for ""mild nudity,"" as opposed to Rx anyway, which is what they use for pornography.The only available English translation for this is a rather poor one by Kingmenu. Of course ""rather poor"" by Kingmenu standards is fucking horrendous for those with a fully developed brain, but at least it's better than no subtitles at all, which some Kingmenu works most certainly call for.";Not Recommended

He is suspected as the murderer as she was found dead in his room with him unconscious also in the room. He gains power from an angel to fight the demon who possessed his bestie who also fucked his gf in demon form I'm pretty sure.Art: Actually the animation all around is pretty good. H scenes are good and the action parts are at least generic shounen quality. We even get to watch a character get fucking punched through the chest. Character models are good and backgrounds are nice.Sound: VA work is good overall. Music is also good. Moans are a bit lacking though I'll be honest.Character: No one is dislikable and the antagonists are fun to watch.Overall: From a technical point it's good, but it starts out with a sex scene which I always hate because I need to get in the mood of the show first, which leaves one scene of a reasonable length to enjoy. Definitely fappable, but needs better moans.With love, Muffed :3;Mixed Feelings

No use of words or spoken audio is done in this film.Note:This animation is the first to use a Multi plane camera. If you are like me and have no idea what i am talking about i will explain it. In other words consider a picture you took from your phone let's say of a selfie. That would be one plane. Inside that picture are objects that are at multiple distances such as the background is most likely farther than your face form the camera. What the Mutli plane camera did was used glass that same picture but only objects of a certain depth away stayed on a glass plane. In other words say plane 1 glass had objects that looked like 1 inch away. Plane 2 had objects that looked 1 foot away. Yada yada... any-who, the point of this was to make for a proper movement zoom in. That is the concept idea in general form. If you are still confused Disney did a good video providing answers on that.StoryA kind illustration on why stealing is bad without a rough approach. To me a rough approach in teaching a lesson is like spanking. It gets the point across but at what cost? The gentle approach they used was through the main character get you the viewer to feel the connection people have with things. Like observing someone mow the grass... or cleaning a pool. Yes, they both are jobs that require work but one does the work so they can appreciate what ever they are working. Do you wish to swim in a filthy pool? Do you want play in the yard if the grass is up to knees?Art-black and whiteSound- no vocals.-Mainly instrumental for some of the instrumental music doubles as slight animation noise in some rare events.Character-perfect amount of history for a character. One doesn't need to know further information.EnjoymentOh if all cartoons/anime could deliver kind hearted messages in this way perhaps then life would be violent? One could only hope. Although, you might be curious to why a 5 when i appear to show such love for this. While i did enjoy the message behind the story the story by itself wasn't gripping. I know it goes against what i just mentioned but i love car chases. I love gun fights. Here, one could say was tame. While can teach your kid a lesson don't expect him/her to re-watch it.;Mixed Feelings

2;Ari-chan;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;5;Ari-chan the Ant is well preserved and well remastered for modern viewing thanks to the work of the Japanese Film Archives who have graciously made the film available to the public for free. The story is a simple moralistic tale about the pitfalls of theft. Ari-chan, the ant in question goes through an epic adventure upon chancing on a violin that they nonchalantly pick up. After following an orchestra of insects deeply reveling in music, Ari-chan realizes that the object they grabbed might be dear to its owner and promptly returns it after a life threatening experience thanks to a giant hand (belong to a human).The sound design is particularly good in this one, especially considering how music plays a pivotal role to the plot. The story is geared primarily towards kids, but is a good representation of the animated works of the time - based on folk tales and morals directed at kids.;Mixed Feelings

With bars ranging from shouts to Mario characters (“Amiri sneaks with the skeleton, I look like Dry Bones”) to the litter of Harry Potter drops in “Half-Blood Prince” (my favorite being “Riding ’round with a Draco, Malfoy”), BabyTron reps his generation and the culture of us who only know the 21st century.;Recommended
1;Monkey Magic;rohan121;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rohan121;9;The story of this anime was pretty interesting. We follow a monkey mc with a mysterious origin that remains unexplained . The mc goes on a journey to gain power when he is confronted with his own weakness of his lack of care for his enemies and life around him. This is a pretty fun battle shounen. We occasionally get to see some spiritual themes in offering the dynamic between the weak and the strong, and grace.The art is pretty cartoonish, but it is very enjoyable. The backgrounds and locations are well detailed like the holy summit. I like how the human characters are designed.The sound is pretty standard with pretty solid voice acting. The ending theme is very well done which stands out.I liked the characters a lot in this anime. The biggest standout was the diety that was constantly praised by every character in the series. His encounters with the cast always made things very interesting. His challenge to Kongo made for a unforgettable scene.My biggest flaw with the series was on how short it was though I doubt it will ever get continued. Pacing issues sometimes occur like how quick Kongo masters some skills. Despite all of that, this anime is a must if you seek a good shounen that is pretty distinct in terms of art and story.;Recommended

Luckily, you get the idea as it progresses. As for the ending it could have been more impacting especially because of the title. The story in a nutshell is fight for survival.As for what the message was it was unclear to me. Maybe strength in numbers? I have a couple other ideas but they don't quite center on the concept of three.Art-black and white-one of the best things i can say is this did a good job of filling in. What i mean is even though there was no sound to any regard there was a couple moments were your mind (or at least mine) played the sound like during the 'whoop whoop' or dazed moments.- i understand with war pieces it is common to have fire of some sort but for me it was annoying. It was as if someone took white out and dribbled it here and there during those moments.Sound- hahaha!Characternormally with shows the main character is clear. Here not so much. I tend to find when films make it clear who to root for (the main character) the show will receive higher reviews for there would be more of an emotional connection made.;Mixed Feelings
0;Heavy;Jeann96;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jeann96;7;"A very interesting and yet unknown Ova from the early 90s, the designs were made by the same guy who do the ""Bounty Hunter"" Ova, so it really haves a good looking style. Story is kind of basic ""underdog goes for the top"" type, but it really has is own ideas, specially depicting the ghettos or bad neighborhoods from that era, and the sort of hard life that people have back then, you know the tale: prostitutes, drunks, extreme poverty and boxing as this sort of chance to make out a leaving, more than a sport.What it surprise me the most was how this Ova decided to show off very ""hot topics"" for the time it was released, despite being a seinen it wasnt the most common thing to do for Ovas of that time period (that tend to be more focused on showing of gore and sex that in developing a story) and the limitations of this tipe of format, specially the AIDs stuff, and how it affected the boxing world, if you are interested on this topic in real life, search for the story of Tommy Morrison, it kinds of remind me that.The story ends up with the first pro fight of Gai, and showing up some flashbacks from his childhood. It continues in the manga, but as far as i know, it was never translated, or seen the light outside of Japan.It was short but really enjoyable, hope the manga see the light someday, somehow.";Recommended
0;Heavy;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;6;Sometimes, you go into an anime knowing it’s a classic. Sometimes, you accidentally stumble upon buried treasure. Heavy from 1990 is solid gold that has somehow been buried until now. The hero of our story is Noburo Ishiguro, best known for directing Legend of the Galactic Heroes. In 1990, he took some time off from directing LotGH and decided to direct one of the greatest “so bad it’s good” anime I’ve ever seen! Heavy is basically Ashita no Joe meets Mad Bull 34 and I loved every minute of it!Our story starts in New York City, where a great boxing coach has been diagnosed with cancer. Due to a brain tumor, he has developed psychic powers and keeps dreaming about a great Asian American boxer that God intends for him to train before he dies. Using his 6th sense, he manages to track the boxer of his dreams to the “Highschool Championship Fight”. In order to reduce gang violence, the mayor of New York City sanctioned official bouts where representatives from different high schools beat the living shit out of each other for bragging and territory rights. These have the blessing of the schoolboard and are attended by cheerleaders, many students, and faculty. The first match is between Japanese American Guy Hyuga (somehow not a Naruto character), and some wrestler. Guy easily beats the shit out of the wrestler, but then the wrestler tries to hit him after the bell, so Guy curb stomps him and nearly kills him! He gets a light scolding from the referee and Guy’s school is announced the winner. The coach begs Guy to become a boxer, but Guy dreams of becoming a certified public accountant. God this anime is a masterpiece! They then hear the sounds of a woman being raped, but Guy is uninterested in seeking help because “Stuff happens in New York.” However, coach scolds him for his cowardice and charges to the rescue saying, “A real American fights for justice!”. Coach gets his ass kicked, but Guy busts through a concrete wall like the Kool-Aid Man and then punches a dude so hard his eyeballs fly out of his skull!That’s all in the first 15 minutes of this 1-hour masterpiece! That’s not even touching upon Guy’s personal trainer. Guy is trained by Lucky Roman, who was the light heavyweight champion of the world. However, he had to retire due to catching AIDS and now runs a drag bar. This anime never stops being melodramatic for a second. It’s just non-stop campiness. There are at least 10 amazingly over the top scenes I didn't describe because I don't want to spoil this whole thing.Heavy was animated by Nippon Animation and Artland, both of whom are highly respected studios that have produced many classics over the years. However, this was definitely a low budget project and often looks pretty rough. Then again, it looks absolutely Godlike compared to its rival boxing anime Kentoushi, which was also released in 1990 and also about a Japanese American heavyweight boxer.The soundtrack is fine. It's not the greatest thing ever, but it gets the job done. The composer was Gorou Oumi, who is mostly known for his work on Silver Fang. So at least Scandinavian anime fans will be familiar with this guy's music.This anime was the most entertaining 50 minutes I've experienced in a while. I had a great time watching this one and if you like cheesy OVAs from the 80s and early 90s, I'm sure you'll love Heavy as much as I did!;Mixed Feelings
0;Tora-chan no Kankan Mushi;DerMensch24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DerMensch24;6;Here is another wonderful work of Kenzou Masaoka. With our main protagonist Tora-chan, this 10 minute short delivers all the aspects of a children's drama.This is one of 2-3 short films involving anthropomorphic felines in their day to day adventures, the others being Tora-chan to Hanayome and Suteneko Tora-chan. The animation for such an early set of shorts is very fluid and characteristic to the Disney shorts of the same era. The story concerns itself more with the characters' goofiness than with consistency, but being targeted towards children audiences its no surprise. The sound quality was average, however depending on which source you use it may differ.Overall its a decent watch and among the trademark anime for this era in animation.;Mixed Feelings
1;Tora-chan no Kankan Mushi;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;5;This wasn't the best of the Tora-chan omnibus of shorts, but subtle allegories about real Japanese life still abound as hidden metaphors in this made for children chaotic story. There's more style than substance at play here - the art is constantly playing with dimensions and colors, lot of experimentation with the flow of fluids and dynamic objects like fireworks that fill life into templates that otherwise lack the expressive background detail to fill the world out and make it lived in.There are some references once again to the obstinacy of elders, the rebelliousness of youth and the consequences of bullheaded obsession with work that might lead to disastrous consequences. The abrupt and explosive ending was a pretty clear reference to the naval battles and the war. The cats quickly moved through the process of the short from wooden fishing boats to modern iron and steel carriers that looked like naval warships. The symbolism of the firecrackers and the attack of the octopi are pretty obvious with this revelatory context.The execution of the story, if one can even pinpoint to a coherent narrative in here, is pretty mediocre. Other Tora-chan shorts have done much better in this aspect and I suggest you watch them first instead.;Mixed Feelings

0;Donguri to Yamaneko;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;7;Donguri to Yamaneko is an intriguing and relaxing picture book-style short OVA based on a Kenji Miyazawa story and narrated by musician Kuni Kawachi. With its dreamlike art and unusual premise, this OVA is certainly worth a watch, although I was left wondering at the end what the point of the story was.Animation in this OVA is limited, and almost like you're looking at pages in a picture book. The dreamlike artwork is captivating, though, and will draw you into the world probably better than a fully animated version would.The background music doesn't stand out on its own, but does add to the ambiance. As for voices, there is only that of the narrator, and he does a satisfactory job.As for the story, we start out with a young boy getting a letter scribbled on a leaf from the wildcat, asking him to attend a trial the next day. On his way to the location of the trial, he asks various natural phenomena where the wildcat is, and gets varying responses, but eventually finds him and his servant, and the trial soon begins. The story itself is rather surreal and whimsical, seeming more like something out of a child's imagination than something actually occurring. The story has a conclusion, but tries to leave things on an open note, making me wonder what the point of all of it was. I kind of felt that way with a similar OVA, Kaze no Matasaburou, which is also based off of a Miyazawa story, so maybe that's less of an issue with the OVA and more of an issue with the original story.As an aside, there is a fansub for this, but it mostly seems to just be a word-for-word pasting of the lines from the translated story, which is in the public domain. Since the OVA wasn't a complete word-for-word retelling of the story, there were a few parts in the OVA that didn't match up with the subtitles (the subtitles had more information than what was actually said).Anyway, overall, I recommend watching this OVA, especially if you're in the mood for a bedtime story.;Recommended
0;Miao Xiansheng;lindor_choco;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lindor_choco;10;Maybe cuz I really like the Chinese culture that is integrated into this film, but apart from that, I think this movie is quite underrated even in the Chinese media. I think it discusses a lot about the world today and the idea of human nature itself. I think the concept is quite solid and how the plot and passing are carried to me were quite neatly done. I'm not going to say much about 'the plot' cuz at the end of the day I think the movie isn't that plot-driven, it's more focused on the core notion that it tried to carry out. So go in with an open mind, I think it was amazing and I really liked the art as well, it's very different and soothing to me. I know it's not the greatest animated movie out there but I think it definitely needs the attention it deserves.;Recommended
0;Rhythm: Koi no Rhythm;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;1;"I haven't been able to write a review for a hentai this easily in a while. Although, it does help when something is complete trash and you get to spend the entire time watching it making fun of it, even if it's one of the most insufferable things that I've ever watched. 15 minutes into the first episode, I already had an entire page of notes to use. And that didn't even include the plot.This 2 episode OVA follows Hiro, a high school student who loves adventure. There is a local legend that there is a hidden treasure located in his home town, and he's made it his mission to find it. After finding a book in the college library, he gets the help of his friend Puri to translate the book, and they both soon team up to find the treasure.Meanwhile, a young woman named Fauna is afflicted with an unusual condition that causes her to not only sleep walk, but feels the uncontrollable need to have sex while sleep walking. Little do both parties know, but both of their stories are intertwined, and that the treasure might help Fauna's affliction.The plot is generic and awful, what little of it there is. Hilariously, it also tries to have plot twists and turns, and even ends on a cliffhanger. It's pretty obvious that this was clearly written in a lunch break. Probably by some guy who was already getting paid minimum wage in terrible working conditions. But since plot in porn isn't why we're here, let's look at the actual porn.Getting this out of the way early in the review, the sex scenes are bad. With the awful animation and art style, it's hard to crank one out to something so ugly. I'm not asking for much, especially with hentai, but Jesus Christ, put SOME mild effort into making it look acceptable. If you're here looking for something to jerk it to, completely skip this one. Although, If you're looking for something to stroke one out to, then you've probably already found something miles better than this doing a general look around any porn streaming or torrent site.As I mentioned earlier, the animation and art style is just truly abysmal. The art style looks like on of those ""Learn how to draw manga!"" things that tried to teach people how to drawn in the 'anime' style, where all of the designs are poorly drawn, non-copyright infringing generic. It's animation is stiff, stilted, and barely there. I know that there wasn't much room for choice in terms of hentai at the time, but even this is pretty bad, even for the time.I'm also pretty this was a studios first foray into digital painting for anime. I'm just hoping this whole project was just so the animators could get used to the software, and this anime was to just recoup some of the costs. I've seen animation on Newgrounds circa 2004 that were better than this, and those were done by some guy in his basement using flash in his spare time.And for some reason, just like Heartwork: Symphony of Destruction, this series decides to use CGI for a lot of it's backgrounds. Even in 1998, when this was released, even the major studios with lots of money had trouble having good CGI for their films, what made the studio think that CGI was OK for this of all things.I never thought that I would say this, but the bad CGI of Heartwork: Symphony of Destruction is better than this.On top of that, it even has a few weird editing choices. For some reason, at some point the hentai decides to transition over from one character to another via crossfade, despite the fact that the anime was already panning over to that character, rendering the crossfade pointless.Do I need to talk about the English dub? Besides the poorly written script, it's the most unenthused voice acting I've seen in a hentai, and is stilted and terrible. And that's an incredibly low bar. And for some reason, the sound mixing is also pretty terrible. Sometimes the voice acting is overpowered by other sounds, other times it sounds tinny, or is literally the only sound happening despite the fact that in the previous shot with the exact same characters standing in the exact same place.The same year, 1998, saw the releases of some pretty great hentai titles, such as Midnight Panther, Kite, and Dragon Knight. I have absolutely no idea why anyone would want to go back and watch this.It doesn't even have the good graces to be so-bad-it's-good. Unless this whole thing was some avant garde hentai, but I doubt it. That's an hour of my life that I'm never going to get back, and I didn't even get a wank out of it.";Not Recommended
0;Ziggy: Soreyuke! R&R Band;delta5;https://myanimelist.net/profile/delta5;5;While Ziggy isn't exactly good, it deserves attention from those who have a taste for the kind of wild, anything goes type of anime that was easily available in the 80s/early 90s OVA scene. The plot's absurd, the characters are barely developed, and the animation is mediocre, but who cares? You get to watch a Japanese hair metal band run around London, play bad songs, and clear themselves of murder charges! The film contains some unintentional comedy at its finest and deserves a viewing (preferably after a few drinks).There are a lot of great moments in Ziggy just waiting for well-deserved mockery, like the band playing an impromptu concert while on the run from the police, and a hilariously sexist and clueless scene where the members of an all-female punk-ish band giggle around in the kitchen, happily cooking a big meal for the all-male members of Ziggy and some assorted British punk dudes. You will also learn, again and again and again, about how important it is to never stop rockin'.To be fair, the people in charge of this production weren't completely deluded into thinking an audience would hail this fiasco as being great art. Once you learn why Ziggy's been framed for murder, it's pretty clear that the whole movie's just meant to be a joke. The big reveal is genuinely hilarious and in the best tradition of campy films featuring rock bands. There's an aerial battle that takes absurdity to new levels, and plenty of other deliberately ludicrous moments leading to the grand finale.I had a lot of fun watching this little gem and definitely recommend it for a certain kind of anime fan. Ziggy is never dull. You'll be laughing (or at least cringing) all the way through. Just don't expect it to be anything more than what it is: an obscure bit of anime that manages to entertain despite itself.;Mixed Feelings
1;Ziggy: Soreyuke! R&R Band;megafat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/megafat;5;"Ziggy: Soreyuke! R&R Band follows Japanese rock Ziggy as they come to London for a recording session, only to find themselves getting attacked by a group of men as the arrive at the hotel. The musicians barely escape with their lives, but soon find out that their producer has been murdered, and they are the suspects. Chased by the police and a mysterious organization who has murdered their producer, they soon find shelter at a local rockers' place.And that mysterious organization? The Nazis. That's right, the Nazis are back and want to take over over the world, but this time they want to take over the world through popular music. I know that this is technically a spoiler, but would you even be paying attention if not for the twist being that hilariously contrived? And to top it all off, the anime has members of Ziggy working with a cop from Scotland Yard who pilots an old World War II plane to attack a Nazi zeppelin to save another member of the band and to try and stop the Nazis.Now, to pull it back a bit so that I don't oversell this OVA, you have to approach this with moderate expectations. As awesome as that premise is for something, it's still not as memorably crazy or over-the-top as some other anime is, like Angel Cop or Mad Bull 34, but I'd argue that in some ways that's better. Sometimes being that over the top is tiring, so seeing something like this being a lot more low key can be a bit more enjoyable to some extent.But considering that the anime's plot is just an excuse to get the whole OVA going and the music being front and center of the whole thing, it's pretty obvious that this was meant to to push the soundtrack that was being heavily featured throughout the whole thing, with the songs being features prominently in the credits.And that's because this was a promotional piece for the real world Japanese rock band Ziggy. But for those who aren't in the know, who exactly are Ziggy?Ziggy was and still kinda is (more on that later) a blues rock/hard rock band that was founded in Morishige Juichi in 1984. Throughout the years, the bands line-up has been constantly changing, with multiple members joining, leaving, and rejoining the band.In the year 2000, they changed their name to ""SNAKE HIP SHAKES"" and released a few albums under than name, but they eventually changed it back to ""ZIGGY"" in 2003. In 2008, the band announced an indefinite hiatus and have only come back for short periods of time in 2010 and 2014, with 2014 being Ziggy's 30th anniversary.The TL;DR read version of it is that this 70 minute OVA was nothing but a promotional piece to put on store shelves to promote the band that it was designed around.The band members didn't even voice the characters in the anime, but I suppose that's because either the band was touring at the time, it would have been too expensive, or the band members either couldn't be bothered to do the voices for the anime or knew that actors would have been a better choice.And this wasn't the only anime to feature the music of Ziggy, with the long-running anime Detective Conan/Case Closed featuring other songs by Ziggy, including ""Happy End"" and ""Step by Step"".Ziggy is an anime that not only could have been made in the 80s, with it's cheesy ""Take down the man with the power of heart and music"" plot and silly soundtrack, but it could have only been made during the Japanese bubble economy where Japan was having an exponential economic growth, which, coincidentally, would pop the year after the released of this anime.And while it's nothing more than a way to sell people on the band, it still enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong, it's not some hidden classic, but it is a mildly amusing romp with a silly plot solely meant to get people to buy more CDs, but it was fun seeing some random 80s band take down the Nazis.";Mixed Feelings
0;Ohi-sama to Kaeru;RedPlaty;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RedPlaty;8;"8/10*Spoilers*Ohi-sama to Kaeru is a 1936 short film meant to be enjoyed by children with some slight propagandist intent which we will get into shortly.Story: 10/10Spoilers are warranted for this film as it is only a minute and change long and the synopsis does not really explain anything. Also I doubt anyone genuinely cares that they are being spoiled in this review, where the time to even just skim through is longer than the total watch time of this anime.Essentially, some frogs and fish are at war with each other and the fish are totally kicking the frogs butts. The frogs, while able to go on land, pray to the Sun which dries up the waterhole the fish live in. The frogs then pray again and it rains, giving water back to the fish. I'm sure you can guess what happens next.I gave it a 10/10 because in just a minute I was actually amazed at the depth of story this film offered. I was honestly sad it was not longer- there are certainly a plethora of other short films old and new that really stretch out that watch time.Art: 10/10Pretty standard stuff for its' time. I enjoyed some of the scenes though, which I won't get into to not be too spoiler-y. I liked the designs and it was pretty easy to understand what was going on. Art is especially important here as there is no dialogue.Sound: 6/10There was some background music and sound effects which complemented the scenes, but there was no dialogue of any kind to cement any explanation into the film. I saw some comments on this animes' forums and some people did not understand what was going on, which I suppose is understandable. This problem also ties back into the fact that it is just over a minute long, so everything is sandwiched in pretty quickly including sound.Character: 7/10No one character stands out from either side. The three ""characters"" are the frog army, fish army, and the Sun. About the propaganda comment I made in the beginning, well japan is known as the ""land of the rising..."" There is still some characterization, such as how vicious the fish were and how powerful the sun was- things like that.Enjoyment: 10/10I was genuinely surprised that I would get such a relatively complex story out of a 1 minute short film. Not rally much else to say at this point. With such a short run time, you either love it or hate it. or it can just fall into that category of ""another one of these, huh. A lot of it really comes down to how you watch it I guess.Overall: 8/10Pretty cute story, fun ""characters"" and just a minute long. No reason why you can't check it out. My only complaint is that with just a minute long, a lot of it seems rushed relative to other films of its time. I mean if they can do this in one minute, imagine two minutes or even three. Regardless, we have what we have, and its good enough as is.";Recommended
0;Coffee Tadaiku;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;7;Rate a 7art piece (no vocals/subtitles)StoryFrom first watch i must say i was mute. I had no feeling. No, i was not struck deeply by the art that it rendered me motionless with my emotions. I just did not feel the point. Maybe it was due to the simplicity or the art portrayal that got me curious to know more about it. Without intense research made and without much in terms of spoilers this story while technically portrayed twice is slightly brilliant.ArtI stated brilliant but why? To answer that we need to go back in time. About 40 or years back. That would be around the time this artist had published his Coffee Break piece. At the time i am sure it was meant to mark his ongoing struggles at work. Frankly, having gotten it published i feel most artists move on to an entirely different piece but not this one. Whether intended from the start or a creative insight along the way the artist still took that art piece but provided a more relevant 'update'. If one would go back to back with both works you can notice clear differences. Such as hair, pet, mug size, imaginations and thus forth. Those differences are what he had to work with. So, this is not just art but a small insight to the artist's life. Not only could play spot the differences between the two pieces but each different stood for something important. For example type writer vs flat screen computer. One requires internet which allows for quick and detailed quality. The other is more comical for one needed more effort for a lower gain result. The joys of advances. Praise be! Now, that you get the general idea let us look at another change, the door. The first published piece was closed. There was no insight to what it was other than a door. Now, the door is open and it reveals an upwards climb to something. For me i saw that a career ladder. These examples are just a few portions of how great an idea it was to revisit and modernize an old piece. My only regret was the artist did not tell the viewer to see the piece that caused him to make Coffee Tadaiku. Or did he?Overall: Best if you like symbolic meanings and progression of past.;Recommended

It's short, cute and makes fun of alot of the tropes/cliches that usually appear in cultivation type stories, drama, donghua, etc. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and though there is an overarching story (an appears will continue onto season 2), the story takes a backdrop to the comedy. I think it is a good watch for the laughs, but if you're hoping for a serious story, this really isn't it.The general plot is: MC and FMC get seperated because of the FMC's condition (and cultivation aptitude) and the MC tries to go after her. He is a ""country bumpkin"" but is rich AF because of the ""useless"" stones that the civilized people view as precious.

If anything, it is probably your bedtime story equivalents in anime form.The animation and sounds, as one could probably tell, are incredibly retro, huge jumps in frames everywhere, slow fps, trumpet sounds like something that would play on the Titanic.

0;Puso Ni Comi: Okawari;DKPropano;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DKPropano;9;Since no one has written a review yet, I'll have the pleasure to be the first and I'll keep it quite short.I had a lot o fun watching this and it has been a while in terms of anime, specially as I grow older and get tired of certain things.The main reason being that I played PSO2, like, A LOT and the development of the story brings you to the aspects of the game in a very fun and enjoyable way. I also loved the art and the OP even though they were nothing from the new world (pun intended). This anime, for the most part, depicts the experience of playing the real PSO2 but with a bunch of anime cliches. Nevertheless, even if you didn't play any PSO2 in your life (or any game of the PSO saga for the most part) you can still watch this and enjoy it to some extent (I guess?). Since the episodes are short and they treat separate aspects of playing the game IRL the story development is practically non-existent. There's, however, some small character developments here and there so the plot is not 100% empty. The point being that there is a sense of cohesion from the first to the last episode, even though you could probably watch them separately and wouldn't notice much difference.In short, I might be pretty biased towards liking things related to PSO, since the Blue Burst saga is my favorite game ever. Notwithstanding that, I believe that this was totally worth the watch and an enjoyable experience. I think that this could be the case for other PSO players that like anime and are looking for some short, non-deep-brain-breaking, fun stuff.;Recommended

Which leaves it entirely to personal take. My take was this was nothing more than a sync of a classic classical song used in synchronized diving but with cells of the human body for characters.Art/sound-black and white mostly. Color is used more in terms of the ending as a mean of conclusion/celebration.-The concept idea of drawn cells vs human form was a poor choice. Classical music is meant to be relaxing. The drawings were in some cases a little bit horrific to look at. Being slightly scared i could not relax. In which all was for nothing.-On a positive note the art blended well with the sounds tempo.-when the art became more face paced the art images began to blur in appearance.Overall: don't expect a story.

0;Xue Yu Xin;ApocalypSnow;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ApocalypSnow;8;What if you and your family were stranded in enemy territory? This anime is a dramatic retelling of the life of Megumi Sunahara, also known as Zhang Rongqing, a Japanese youth unable to return to Japan from China after World War II. And because of the setting, it’s also about the founding of New China. Since the protagonist identifies as Chinese and joins the People’s Liberation Army, and there are many mentions of the Chinese villagers’ goodness, it sometimes feels like watching a propaganda film. And I’m sure there’s an agenda behind Xue Yu Xin (Blood and Heart), but I’ll review the premise, execution, characters, art and animation, and soundtrack.PREMISE: Has the potential to be boring if you don’t care about history. Raises warning flags if you’re familiar with the history between China and Japan.During WW2, Japan oppressed China. Some Japanese civilians lived in China like Fire Nation colonies. When Japan lost the war, colonials needed to leave en masse, which resulted in terrible traveling conditions and some people getting left behind—including Megumi and his mother and younger sisters. He is the only one in his family who can speak any Mandarin.EXECUTION: Brilliant and heart-wrenching.Each scene feels like it matters—to frame the story, set the tone, show the world, etc. There’s no exposition dump at the beginning, though there is narration to explain time skips and other significant changes.At the end of each episode, there’s a segment like from a documentary. As in, real-life or dramatized clips instead of animation, and narration instead of dialogue. If you’re interested in history, it’s a great extra! But if you just want action or story, these extras are literal exposition dumps removed from the anime itself. Take it or leave it. :)CHARACTERS: There is essentially only one character—the main character. And maybe the colonel. Everyone else exists as a one-dimensional paper doll or as a role to advance Megumi’s character.Maybe it’s the runtime, but there were missed opportunities to better flesh out Megumi’s relationships with other characters, especially the rest of his family. His mother is literally nameless. And I was surprised that he as the oldest sibling could speak Mandarin while his younger sisters couldn’t. There’s a good scene where his sisters are chased by another kid for being Japanese, and Megumi scolds his sisters for going outside when they need to hide their identities. Aaand then it’s never mentioned again.ART & ANIMATION: Solid artwork, decent animation. I like Megumi’s character design—simple, but not too plain compared to the other characters. And I really like the clips in the documentary segments.SOUNDTRACK: Amazing. You’ll either like or hate the OP, which switches singer and style for the last part. The ED, like almost all donghua EDs, is beautiful and fits the anime well.I recommend Xue Yu Xin if you’re curious about the history of China or a story about a Japanese boy living his best life as a Chinese-identifying soldier who helped create modern China! ^^;Recommended
0;Jiandao Di Yi Xian;drinfantom;https://myanimelist.net/profile/drinfantom;8;Good anime. I recommend it to people who like Wushen Zhuzai. I wish it was complete though. The 20 episodes that are there can basically be summarized into the synopsis given with like the added fact that MC is OP and is just getting started on his comeback to power by establishing his dominance in his new family with some weird side romance type of deal going on aside from his wife. It has the feel that its going to be like Wushen Zhuzai (The god of war dominates). However this anime's 20 episodes only shows you like the first 10 episodes worth of story progression of the 272 in Wushen Zhuzai. If they made 200+ episodes I could maybe rate this anime higher but it feels so underdeveloped for 20 episodes, I wish they could add more.;Mixed Feelings
0;Attack No.1: Namida no Sekai Senshuken;ooReiko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ooReiko;10;This film is probably the best one of the 4 recap films of the Attack No 1 series, I'd go as far to say that in some ways it was even better than the corresponding part of the original series.The story covers the international tournament arc that takes place in New York. The film focuses mainly on the matches and cuts out some stuff that was in the original series that happened outside of the matches. I think that made the film feel more straight forward and easier to digest, while also focusing on the matches and the struggle of Kozue and her team throughout the tournament.The art is one of the strengths of the film as the girls emotion and struggle is visually portrayed in very good fashion reminiscent of the 60s shoujo manga design style which I think emphasises the emotion and visual identity of the characters. One of the most clever visual metaphors used throughout the original series and the film is the sparkles in the eyes of the characters decipting the rivalry and tense moments of struggle of the characters. Which I think adds significant amount of visual personality to the design of the series.Sound is another part that is reminiscent of the original series after the first scene the iconic theme song from the series plays which I think adds another layer of excitement towards the tournament when the girls are starting their journey. The voice acting is also really good, portraying the raw emotion and struggle of the characters in precise and dramatic manner which I think enhances the overall enjoyment of the film.The important characters when it comes to this film are the coach and Ayuhara Kozue herself. The coach is probably one of yhe most iconic characters from the original series and his portrayal in this film does not leave you cold. I'd say that his character was portrayed better in the original series, but for this film I think he was fine.Kozue the another important character I'd say that her relationship with the coach, her teammates and rivals are the interesting part of this film. The way those relationships play into her struggle throughout the tournament I think is laid out beautifully in the film and the ending pays respect to that struggle.Overall I'd say this film provides a good portrayal of the events compared to the original series and in some ways even better when it comes to the tournament arc as a complete package.;Recommended

(Hence why it's the Final) So I would recommend this to tie of everything, but it won't be very interesting to someone who hasn't seen everything else.A 5 on story from me, because their really isn't much of a story.Art:The art is super deformed chibis.

0;Wu Ying Sanqian Dao;iamKetranLang;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iamKetranLang;7;"This has been a short season. It is OK to watch because the episodes are short, and the story has very good potential to get better further down. However, there are a number of flaws. I had some fun in the beginning and overall for the most part, but so far it did not stay interesting for long.The MC did not build any meaningful relationship after he reincarnated into another guy's body. He just assumed the guy's identity and what may have at first been an unlucky reincarnation turned good way too easily. Because everyone think he sucks, all he has to do is use the power of the bowl that old guy gave him and everyone think he did something. The girl automatically likes him and I was hoping he had to object more about his new life to create a more interesting challenge.My biggest complaint is that there is not enough surprising development that come from him taking on someone else's identity. Instead though, everything stays status quo, no one questions him but just happy that he wins the fight. He stays playboy and don't change cause he got the power of the bowl and the two characters that found his secret don't even expose or do anything, for what purpose do they even need to be here? So yes, the enemies who ""don't know"" he got the power of the bowl lose.The art is rather stiff especially the girl, she can't smile normally. The fights look pretty good and the weapons are pretty cool. The Martial Arts is a bit lacking because just saying the MC's sword has aura and the power of the bowl is not enough, give him super speed sword techniques that would actually pump up the fight. It'd be more serious and strong to show at the speed he could move to better express to others to rethink out again some new developments to test him.The story could get better easily like if someone steals his bowl or there is some underlying drawback from the bowl, he is chosen to do some grave assignment (that would actually thus need all his culminated power) or he leaves the house and gets jumped by some unknown trouble related to the other identity of his (like he was involved in a crime, or someone out there he not aware of is plotting) which would better yet start requiring him to protect himself.I'll still be watching this one if it continues because the setting is not bad and I really think it could get better depending on the direction, but we will see.";Recommended
1;Wu Ying Sanqian Dao;Tsuyo_Mika;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tsuyo_Mika;8;"Wu Ying Sanqian Dao is an adaptation of the ongoing novel ""Eternal First Son-in-law"". This has 10 episodes with an average length of 8 minutes, and this is not enough to introduce the entire background of the story. This donghua serves to be a decent promotion for the novel. It lays out only a little about the background setting of the novel, considering the duration of each episode. Scenes are not continuous and random, which is understandable considering how much they've tried to fit in to the donghua to make sense.As for the characters, Xu Wuzhou was thought to be a trash and our main character continues the facade until the need for him to display his power arises. Speaking of powers, he shows powers only to the extent capable enough to defeat his enemies. His powers are like a cheat code, gaining levels and skills easily. It's a fun watch considering how he ends up being misunderstood easily, even after being fairly OP.";Recommended
0;Ai to Ken no Camelot: Mangaka Marina Time Slip Jiken;LovelyStoneWitch;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LovelyStoneWitch;6;It's been awhile since I actually reviewed something so... while looking for an old 90s anime to watch (I've already watched the more well known 90s animes like Sailor Moon, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Dragon Ball Z), I stumbled upon a one episode OVA called Ai to Ken no Camelot: Mangaka Marina Time Slip Jiken, but from here on out, we'll refer to it as Camelot because the title is a mouthful.So, what drew me to watch Camelot? Well, from the title cover that's shown on MAL, it kinda reminded me of the Fushigi Yuugi manga, or in the least mangas like it and I thought that the premise sounded a bit interesting, especially since I'm a big fan of the Arthurian Legends. But I kinda dreaded watching this because while the premise is interesting, I don't think the adventures of a girl and her group of 5 guy friends (I think one of the guy friends is actually a girl?) can be told and completed in an hour long episode, at least not without rushing the plot.Story: 6/10What's the story about? An aspiring manga artist, Marina is invited to a friend's birthday, along with four of her guy friends. When the whole gang arrives a freak storm happens that transports Marina and her guy friends all to the anime's version of Camelot, and with it, Marina is chosen by the very dragon that transports her and her friends to Camelot to save it. To be honest, while I liked the story well enough, but I was right when I thought that it'd be bad to try and cram a whole fantasy plot like this into just 50 minutes. Everything was rushed and I was kinda confused as to what the heck was going on and how the characters all know each other, and I kinda wanted to see and know more about the anime's version of Camelot. But alas I couldn't because of the time constraint and the plot being rushed. It's too bad because I'm sure if this anime were to be given a lot more episodes (maybe roughly about the same amount of episodes in modern animes--10-26 episodes) it would've been a good one. Because I enjoyed the story enough I'm gonna be lenient on it and give it a 6.Art: 7/10While I watched the anime on a site that looks like someone uploaded a VHS rip (that they managed to clean up some), I will say that the art and animation were probably it's best quality. I mean as far as that 80s style transitioning into the 90s style goes, it's pretty good. Everything was smooth and detailed despite the weird vhs quality of the video I watched.Sound: 5/10While this anime did have some good voice acting and music, the fact that you can hear the buzzing sound of whatever device was used to record and rip the video from a vhs tape kinda messes with the audio quality, which is why I knocked off some points.Character: 5/10The characters were all... okay. The art and animation and designs of all the characters were what you'd expect of your typical shoujo anime. You have the long haired flirty pretty boy, the princely character, the rash kind hearted male character you know is gonna end up with the heroine anyways, the laid back cool guy, etc. Basically all of Marina's guy friends are the typical character tropes you would find in a shoujo anime/manga featuring a girl with a bunch love interests. Marina herself is as she appears, childish and naive and only thinking of food (What is with all the female leads in all of these Shoujo animes and mangas being in love with food?). Her design is cute but my only question is if she's supposed to be the same age as her guy friends, why does she look like a little kid? What is her relationship to her guy friends? How do they know each other?! Also, I can't remember any of the character's names, that's how much I didn't really care for them. I only remembered Marina's name because her name is in the title and she's the main character (even though she's not in the cover art).Enjoyment: 5/10So, I didn't enjoy this that much, it's not because of the vhs quality of the video or the annoying buzzing sound of whatever was used to record the video. It was the subtitles. They were distracting because the subs were a literal translation of what the characters were saying so I couldn't pay any attention to what's going on with the characters because I was too busy trying to make sense of the English subs. But I did enjoy this anime to some extent.Overall: 6/10SO what are my final thoughts? Well, while it's highly disappointing that this ova wasn't fleshed out more (I can only guess this was an ova that was used to try and pitch a new idea for a new series), the anime isn't that bad, it's more or less average. There are still some things to enjoy about it, but don't expect a cohesive story with a lot of character development because while there are some minor moments of characters bonding with each other (ie when one of Marina's guy friends actually kisses her after he gets injured or all the friends having a laugh after teasing her a little) there's not enough time to actually get to know the characters and to feel their bond. You're just left with a straight to the point story that leaves you with the feeling that there could have and should have been more. And it doesn't help that there's hardly any information about this anime anywhere. I can't even find who made it outside the production or publishing company, some of the story writers, and the director. In the end, this is an obscure mediocre/average OVA that was probably someone's failed pitch for a full fledge shoujo series and it's a shame because I did see some potential to the story. Maybe in the future, the person who originally came up with this OVA or someone who enjoyed it enough will give this anime the full fledged series that it deserves. Until then, all I can say is, if you're planning on watching it, go in with low expectations and don't expect it to be something similar to Fushigi Yuugi despite what the summary/premise of the OVA says.;Mixed Feelings
0;Ai to Ken no Camelot: Mangaka Marina Time Slip Jiken;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;"“Ai to Ken no Camelot: Mangaka Marina Time Slip Jiken” is a shoujo fantasy movie (it seems that it’s not an OVA) based on one of the books in the “Mangaka Marina” series of novels. While its art, animation and music are passable, the story is rushed and full of confusing narrative decisions, and the dialogue is hackneyed. In addition, the characters suffer from a lack of background information that would help the viewer empathize with them and differentiate them from one another, making this a forgettable watch.“Mangaka Marina” is a series of novels that were published from the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s. The series has never been translated into English as far as I know, and the books are currently out of print. The book the story comes from was published just a few months before the movie’s release, so I presume the goal of this movie was to increase book sales and give fans of the series a chance to see and hear their favorite characters on screen.The movie starts out assuming that you already know about the characters and their relations with each other. Since this is based on such an obscure novel (and not even the first one in the series, at that), the majority of viewers will be confused. Who are these people? Why are they friends? How do they know each other?The main characters are the titular Marina, a third-rate mangaka who looks and acts like a 10-year-old but is apparently an adult; Kazuya, a half-Japanese guy whom Marina likes; Charles, a super-intelligent French guy; Kaoru, a crossdressing woman; Bijomaru, your typical traditional Japanese guy; and some guy named Kirk.The gist of the plot is this: Kaoru invites them all to a birthday party at her mansion, and tells them to bring their “present” of “what the meaning of love is.” The party is interrupted by a dragon that crashes through the window and grabs Marina. The others grab onto the dragon and are whisked away to medieval England, where Marina has been tasked with helping Arthur pull out Excalibur to become the rightful King of England. Why Marina? Who knows. She even has a hard time remembering what the dragon asked her to do as its dying wish. After lots of mishaps, the gang figures out the necessary conditions for obtaining the sword, but some of the most stereotypical and one-dimensional villains ever plan to get in their way.The movie stuffs too much plot into its 48-minute runtime. It goes from beat to beat quickly, without giving much explanation as to what is going on or why. Also, some of the scenes don’t make much sense. For instance, when Marina chokes on her dinner, she’s immediately offered medicine to swallow. How can she swallow if she’s choking? And later, she uses a cloth as a makeshift balloon to glide through the air, and walks through a desert in England. Some romantic subtext, with overused dialogue, is shoved in between Marina and a number of other characters, particularly Arthur and Kazuya. What these guys see in her is beyond me. The “comedy” in this movie is also cringeworthy. There’s a nonsensical “twist” with the villain near the end that comes out of nowhere, and the ending itself is underwhelming.Regarding the technical aspects of “Camelot,” characters (with the exception of Marina) are drawn in a typical shoujo style, with big eyes and upside-down triangle-shaped heads. The background art is unremarkable. The animation is decent; movement throughout the whole movie is fairly fluid, although some characters move strangely sometimes (like the dragons). The music is okay. Both the opening and ending are pleasant to listen to, particularly the opening, which is set to real-life pictures of Tokyo with Marina superimposed on them. The soundtrack isn’t memorable, but it’s not bad, either. “Camelot” has a strong voice cast, but the actors’ performances don’t stand out.There isn’t too much potentially objectionable content in this. There’s a scene where Marina calls some wolves “perverts” for trying to bite off her shorts, and there are some minor scenes with blood, violence and death. There’s also a shower scene with the crossdressing girl near the beginning, but nothing is really shown.Overall, unless you’re a fan of the novels, which you probably aren’t, I don’t recommend watching “Camelot.” It doesn’t have enough to offer that would make it particularly appealing to anyone else.";Not Recommended

(I'm actually surprised this is a new-ish anime tbh, lmao)Was introduced to this by a YouTube clip from Ruggington, and have now just had the chance to binge it. And I'm glad I did, that was the best 2 hours I've sat through in a good while. It's actually still ongoing from what I know; at least for English sub and dub. I watched the first 18 episodes in English dub (since that's all that's available for the dub right now), which I recommend you do too for the better experience (it's better comedy). For the remaining 7 episodes, look up a channel on YouTube called ""Bottle capman"". The last few episodes will be RAW since subs don't exist for them yet, but hey, at least you can see what happens (this channel was the only place I could find the episodes too lol).The game of Bottleman itself is basically Beyblade but with... bottlecaps, obviously, and taken to the next level. This should honestly be a sport irl lol (I'm aware toys for this exist but like... it should be an actual competitive thing).A couple of quick good points (imo):- The characters are TRUE gangsters!- Serious point, but the MC of this is actually more competent than the ones from Beyblade Burst (Sparking at the very least). Not sure if I should be concerned there.- That outro song is a real banger (there's sadly no opening theme)!My only complaint about this anime really is that episodes end way too fast. Even 10 minute episodes like currently Beyblade Burst would do me tbh.Hopefully we get a season 2 someday though!But seriously, please give it a shot, even if just for a laugh.";Recommended
0;Da Shi Jie;Effete;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Effete;7;A Tarantino-esque crime-comedy that's light on the comedy and irony and a bit heavier on slow, cynical atmosphere.The slightly ugly character designs pair fairly well with how acerbic and cynical most of the characters are, but the visuals and some of the backgrounds and graphics look, if not pleasing, then at least interesting. Extremely limited animation at times, with only mouths moving and shot-reverse-shot between characters, but it's never painful to look at either. A couple of longer shots on scenery are nice and none of the framing and so forth really compares much to anime, it's a lot closer to Western film in general and particularly indie-animated American films in the same vein.A lot of inconsequential dialogue, a lot of chitchat and jokes without punchlines and so forth. I would never call this film clever or unique, but it's well executed. It knows what it wants to do and it does that well. Slower, slightly atmospheric, etc. The lingering shots of an item, a body, or a scenic background with the decent sound work can be pleasurable despite feeling like padding sometimes.That said, it does feel a little aimless, a little drawn out, a little crass. It's only 70+ minutes long, but it felt 30 minutes longer than that, mostly in a bad way. I don't know if I could recommend it to anyone beyond the novelty. It's solid for what it is though.;Recommended
1;Da Shi Jie;fairatbest;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fairatbest;7;A dark meditation on the false promise of Chinese Communism and the lower classes’ desperate search for economic prosperity. Have a Nice Day features a wide ensemble of characters who are united in their poverty within Chinese society. The film demonstrates how, without meaningful opportunites to advance economically, there’s hardly room for the moral nuances of these characters’ survival struggle (which leaves little room for the viewer to judge.)Characters can subscribe to the spiritual schools of Buddha, Bill Gates or Mao and still not have the means to afford quality plastic surgery (like the Koreans), let alone material bliss in the form of online shopping. But hey, it’s good to dream of Shangri-la, right?The film’s quintessential scene involves one character explaining 自由 (zìyóu or freedom) using the analogy of shopping, perhaps more specifically of affording. From that story, it’s clear: None of these people are free. Freedom isn’t found in poverty - but violence is. And things are going to get real bloody.;Recommended
0;High School! Kimengumi (Movie);Catalano;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Catalano;7;"High School! Kimengumi (Movie) is a 1986 comedy anime movie which aired in-between the main series (1985-1987), it is based on a popular Weekly Shounen Jump manga (1982-1987). Basically, the anime was so popular that they made a movie out of it with new material.You don't have to watch the series or read the manga first to understand this movie, the main focus of Kimengumi is comedy, which is delivered in an episodic way. This, I reckon, would be a good intro to the main TV anime, it's a relatively short anime (just a 50 minutes watch) that gathers all of its charm to make a presentable look.This movie presents the characters in the first moments in order to accustom the viewer in case they didn't see the first anime episodes, I think it's a good choice, we get to know the main cast in a slow introduction so we can keep up for what comes next.The film is split in 3 parts, each part telling a different story but the overall premise it simple: there are 5 guys that call their group ""Kimengumi"" which translates to ""Funny Face Gang"", what they do is, causing ruckus around the school, that's the whole premise. Every normal high school thing that you know, these guys will make it into a funny/dumb/idiotic situation. For example, in the first segment, the guys have supplementary lessons because of their bad grades, the teacher tries to make them study but the gang can't concentrate, they will do just about anything instead of studying, which means transforming into ""chibi"" (deformed) versions of themselves and acting like idiots.The main characters aka the Kimengumi group:- Ichidou Rei (the leader)- Reietsu Go- Daima Jin- Shusse Kiyoshi- Monohoshi DaiSome minor yet sometimes important characters:- Kawa Yui (literally meaning ""cute"")- Uru Chie (Yui's close friend)- Jidai Sakugo (the angry teacher)Being a full classic comedy show, the characters are extremely important and this show has them. Rei is the leader of the group, a man who prides himself of scoring 0 at all tests, the other boys are a muscle training nut sorta macho-man, a boy with a big face, another with a forever big cartoonish smile and the regular pretty boy who talks softly.Kawa Yui is a cute and adorable girl who is friends with the group for who knows what reasons, Uru Chie is Yui's close friend, she's a hot tempered girl.These guys from the gang aren't that much unique in terms of personality or do they act in a way which would make the watcher remember them individually. In this sense, you may find them boring and unappealing but in my case, I very much enjoyed watching their shenanigans, despite different, the boys work well together as a group.The action tends to go over the top, so it's a treat for the watchers who love absurd comedies like Nichijou, Aho Girl, Plastic Nee-san etc. The characters transform into super deformed creatures from time to time, the teacher punches anyone, some girl (Uru Chie) screams like she's possessed, one minute you're watching a relaxing day by the beach, next thing, you're seeing high schoolers swimming in shark infested waters, fighting to win the unusual trophy presented by a teacher. Expect random and silly fights but dramatic in style.The 3rd part is a bit longer than the previous two, it's the same in regards to the overall atmosphere, but now we're in a bad kung-fu 70s movie, the gang have to fight some random dudes because some girls were kidnapped. One of the bad guy uses the drunken fist (like Jackie Chan) and in the beginning we have a Hokuto no Ken reference. Even if you don't know the references, our characters apply their own thing to it, so the result is funny, it made me laugh and in the end, that is this movie's goal.The show presents a laid back atmosphere, pretty chill, good to watch if you're tired of the old plot-heavy stories. It has some good music too, as the 3 parts are divided by 3 minutes songs, these encapsulate well the 80s feel and enriches the watching experience. The cinematography of the music videos gets you into the right mood, it relaxed me and made me feel cozy and comfy.The animation is mediocre, not saying is bad, it's just not that special, we don't have many still shots though (so that's a plus). Character designs may be a throw off, our main boys look silly, the girls aren't that hot (just your usual big eyes, slender body, cute voice). Kimengumi doesn't need cool art to be interesting for its appeal is the the gang's shenanigans and the deformed faces work well to exaggerate the humor, I think it fits.No sexual fanservice, maybe a cleavage and some swim suits in the 2nd part but that's it, no sexual innuendos either. Imagine Prison School but without the ecchi fanservice yet keeping all the ""drama"" and absurd comedy.In conclusion, if you're in it for some 80s comedy lasting 50 minutes, with high schoolers doing dumb things because they're idiots but they're having a good time, you can watch it. As for the ending, it looks just like the usual episodic ending, the matters are resolved, the group is having a good laugh, Yui is still cute. The ending doesn't matter, what it matters is you having a good laugh, it sure worked for me because I like silly things and anime boys and girls having fun in high school. There is a long anime and manga out there, I'm sure those have a proper ending to the series/franchise, so look there if you need closure.";Recommended
0;Fruits Version;Muffed;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Muffed;7;My fellow degenerates,Today I bring you Fruits Version.Now, this is clearly old hentai, but not actually bad in my opinion. I feel it has some important things going for it.Art: Fairly static most of the time, but has some good motion during H scenes. Obviously, the classic old-school character designs aren't really my favorite, but passable.Sound: This is where for me at least, it has a big plus compared to other low-rated hentai I subject myself to. The moans are VERY copious and I do love moaning. Actually, VA work is fairly bleh nothing notable or memorable whatsoever. The music I'm not a fan of, and also, during the first main H scene there literally isn't music at all. I didn't mind it as music would've dampened the moaning.Characters: Three main ones are brother and two sisters. Other than the younger sister being awakened in likely one of the most damaging ways to the pleasures of sexual activity and her libido, there isn't really character development. The brother is fairly easily coerced and also wants to fuck his little sister. Older sister is a stubborn, go-getter who wants to fuck her brother. Younger sister is an innocent high schooler who wants to fuck her brother. Congratulations, it's just a house of incest.Story: Younger sister gets molested, awakens to sexual gratification, has sex with her older sister, then her brother. Older sister gets pissy that her hole isn't filled by big bro's big dick and sets him up to show younger sister pics of him filling older sister's friend's holes. She feels she isn't the special hole anymore and rejects him. End episode. That's essentially what happened. Maybe older sister will finally get her hole filled? Who knows. But what we do know is that brother isn't filling little sister's hole for a hot minute.Overall? Definitely fappable if you love exaggerated moaning like I do. Audio quality be damned if there's a moaner, I've got a boner.With love, Muffed :3;Recommended

2;Padak Padak;akagramb;https://myanimelist.net/profile/akagramb;9;Okay, what did i just watched? This movie has a super character development. I mean, by first sight you may say this is just a movie about fishes but hell the end hits hard.I see lots of topics into here, the learned helplessness, the model of social conformism, surviving hard times and coping mechanism. The art is good and music is fine, maybe the style is not the best but what can you ask when using CGI in 2012, anyhow the script even though they are only fishes is daring and herathbreaking. Just, a whole new experience. I will never regret this movie.Top films that make you think that you eat.;Recommended
3;Padak Padak;IzzyMarrie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IzzyMarrie;7;"This was a great movie, but not one for the faint of heart. It's a depressing, yet bittersweet tale about fish in a tank in front of a restaurant, whose fate is seemingly set in stone.To address the biggest issue I see in this movie, I have to mention the art style. Most of the time, the CG is god awful to look at. Other times, it's tolerable. It's not even a matter of the dull colors and bland look. That can work to a certain degree in an almost ""realistic"" type of setting. It's hard to describe. Each human looks nasty, and not even in a grotesque ""they're the monsters in this story"" type of way, but a ""the animators are new but determined to make a movie"" sort of way. The beginning doesn't look so awful, but immediately after the market scene, you see a child whose face and how it's animated look like if you take Sid's face from Toy Story but give it a less ""clay-like"" look where it's at least brushed over and looks soft and give it a 3-4 x's downgrade where it looks like it's lost texture. The coloring and outlining look flat and blunt, to put it nicely. And the design, while probably purposefully made to look unattractive, unlike Sid, just doesn't have any charm.Unfortunately, MANY of the humans are like this. Not always, mind you. But most of the time. It's like if you took the animated baby that was passed around in email chains back in the day, saw it, and said to yourself ""this is actually really good!""In regards to the other parts of the art direction, the camera work is always really interesting. There are times where it focuses higher at human level to make the fish feel extremely small, while other times, it brings you down to the fishs' height. The song segments, too, also get very experimental with the art change. THAT part of the art direction is absolutely beautiful. It surprised me first seeing this movie just how pretty the art was at these points.Sound direction was decent. There were times during emotional scenes especially where the ambience made me even more immersed in the moment. I also really love the music. The musical numbers are all very nice. I've seen some people compare the songs to Disney in quality, and I can kinda see it. Only complaint is a few songs didn't really feel like they furthered the plot or really gave us something new about the character, while at other times, the songs did just that.The characters themselves were great, mostly simple but were still played out nicely. You have your ""villain"", a bully in the tank who is a flatfish that was previously living in the sea like the main character, a mackerel, who is determined to flop to the sea. They're your two main characters, along with an important secondary character who is a young fish who is inspired by the mackerel, hopeful and kind. I was honestly surprised by how the development for the flatfish went as he was easily an unlikable prick when he's first introduced. The mackerel is kind of your standard ""I'm going to beat the odds!"" type of character, however, but she's alright. Despite the tropeiness, the characters all served their purpose nicely.There's also an eel that is like a snake, the lackey of the flatfish. He's in charge of rallying the fish to solve ""riddles"" each night, where the winner gets to eat a piece of the tail of the fish furthest from the right answer. There's 3 others, too, fish species I cannot remember, but you have a tired and somewhat dumb one, one who's openly apathetic as well as another who's even more-so. Otherwise, those 3 are the least interesting in the tank, while at least the eel is an okay villain with a fun song number.The sea is within a short distance from the tank, but the issue is the humans which will instantly go after them (and the lid being placed on top at night). The flatfish taught those in the tank to play dead whenever a customer is spotted so that they'll eye another tank, coming back to life when the workers are by themselves so that they aren't thrown out. It made for an interesting set up, especially with the hierarchy in the tank being thrown into question with the mackerel being brought in.Overall, it's not a long movie, and I think it's well worth the watch. I say that anyone watching it should give it at least 15-20 minutes before deciding to duck out. It's a good movie, like a macabre take on Finding Nemo but ""Nemo"" is freedom and the journey is without comedy or a completely happy ending..";Recommended
4;Padak Padak;KamuiX1999;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KamuiX1999;8;Ever wonder what Finding Nemo would have been like if it was a dark, grim and depressing movie with psychological thriller, horror, and survival film elements? Of course you haven't, you're a normal person. But if you watch this, you'll get to find out, and holy shit is it a one-of-a-kind experience. This film is like little else I've ever seen, maybe the closest animated films I could compare it to would be Perfect Blue or Grave of the Fireflies, but even then this is a whole other beast. Death, despair, nihilism, gore, fucking Disney-like songs to express all of these elements... this is a totally unique film that knocked me for a loop. It's better to just experience it I feel than to say too much, but I will say if you're not in the mood for something that will linger around and make you feel bad for a bit after the credits roll, skip it until you're prepared. And yeah, I'm still talking about an animated film about fish.My only gripe is that I wish it was traditionally animated instead of CGI (whenever there's a song, it switches to normal animation and it's beautiful), and to be totally honest the style of CGI used is kind of ugly, but with a story this strong, it's not a huge deal. Seriously, check this out if you're looking for something completely different. You'll never eat fish again without thinking of this film.;Recommended
0;Padak Padak;resinweber;https://myanimelist.net/profile/resinweber;6;"7/7/5/6/7/6I wandered into one of the viewing rooms at FanimeCon just this weekend (memorial weekend 2016) during the very beginning of this movie. I thought to myself, ""hey, this is pretty cute"", not to mention I had a couple hours until the next panel I planned on going to.Now, what I have to say about this, is that it's a lot like Finding Nemo--- only that it gets really fucking brutal in a subtle, built-up way. The crazy thing is that this was obviously meant for kids.MILD-MEDIUM SPOILERS AHEAD: (Though personally, I don't think these will ruin the movie experience, but rather, make you realize what exactly I mean.)So, yeah, like I said, its a lot like finding nemo. It's even got that Pixar feel to it. However, shit starts to get real because apparently the Koreans do not like to white-wash their shit, like how (for example) sometimes fish attack each other and feed on their corpses. So while it's kind of cute, I started building some level of empathy for these little fishies, especially Padak, the main character. ""Padak"" is apparently the Korean onomatopoeia for the sound a fish makes when it flips around on land, hence the name ""Flippy"" in the description of this movie. Padak is a fish in captivity, living in an aquarium tank in front of a fish restaurant/market. She wants to escape back to the ocean and tries to convince her new fishy friends to either help her or to do the same. Only one fish, a mean and rugged flatfish, knows about the sea. Drama ensues inside the tank, some fish fighting, and some dying in the process, only to be fed upon by the other fish. Sometimes, they have to ""play dead"" in order not to get picked by the customers of the market, and do other things in order to survive in the tank. What really got me was when one actually did get taken out, and he was taken to the table to get slaughtered and eaten. It looked on in horror as the cook beheaded and gutted his half-dead comrades, throwing their guts and bones in the garbage disposal and searing their bodies on a stove.So, I would say this was rather interesting. Just like a fucked up ""Finding Nemo"". For that reason I give the plot somewhere around a 7 or 8 even.The art was nice, because like I said it looked like a pixar film. So I give it a 7.The sound/music didn't really captivate me. I never really noticed it. I give it a 5.Characters weren't totally fleshed out, though I did feel some empathy for some of them. I give that area a 6.";Mixed Feelings
0;Kuroi Kikori to Shiroi Kikori;Sesshomaru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sesshomaru;8;"黒いきこりと白いきこり - Kuroi Kikori to Shiroi Kikori is an animated short film of 15 minutes including opening and ending credits. The anime was first released in 1956 and the story is from the original work by Hamada, Hirosuke.Story: Good vs. Evil - Actions & Rewards - Early masterpiece, a beauty of Japanese animation (8/10)It is about a bear, a fox and a squirrel trying to find warm shelter during a snowstorm. The story starts slowly but becomes increasingly exciting. The author of the original story, Hamada Hirosuke, was born in Takahata in 1893 and was one of the most famous children's and young people's authors of his time, along with Mimei Ogawa and Tsubota Jōji. Some of his most famous works are ""The Tears of the Dragon"" and ""The Little Mouse Who Tarried"". The anime adaptation of Kuroi Kikori to Shiroi Kikori presents itself as an old folk tale and stays true to the original story. At the same time, it tries to give young viewers the moral guidance one would expect from a children's book.Characters: simple, good vs. evil, plus anthropomorphism - interesting (8/10)Anthropomorphism is the practice of attributing human characteristics to animals, gods, etc. Human characteristics can be both physical and behavioural. Mori, Yasuji, who was already known as an illustrator of children's books, was a master of his craft. He was the first to make the later very popular style of anthropomorphism socially acceptable. Not surprisingly, this anime bears Mori-san's signature, with beautiful animal drawings with human characteristics (e.g. walking on two legs). So why a bear with a collar, a fox and a squirrel? Perhaps simply because they were cute to draw. On the other hand, considering that Shintoism is an elemental religion in Japan, perhaps it is worth looking at the characteristics of animals in mythology.Every development begins with the first step. If you think about it further, you will come to today's stylistic device, ""Kemonomimi"". For example: ""Spice and Wolf"", Kitsune as a fox deity with fox ears and tail.Kuroi Kikori: The black woodcutter represents the evil craft by treating the bar, the fox and the squirrel badly.Shiroi Kikori: The white lumberjack has the appearance of a grandfather. He represents the good character who cares for those in need and will not leave them without help, welcoming them and offering them food and shelter.Yuki Onna: The Snow Woman is a fictional Japanese folklore character classified as a Yōkai. She is described as a petite woman or girl dressed in a snow-white kimono with knee-length white hair. In rare cases, her hair is depicted as pitch black.Visuals: Animation and graphics are wonderful, character drawings are charming (8/10)The first thing you notice is that the art is amazingly detailed, especially the character drawings by Mori, Yasuji, who was and is famous for his cute animal drawings that still bear witness to his creativity. All of his work was important for the next generation of mangakas and is still used as a reference today. On top of that the animation is brilliant, energetic and expressive. Please remember that this was 1956. Everything had to be done with cell animation, which is relatively difficult to do as it requires a lot of experience, especially in colouring. The artistry of the backgrounds and characters, as well as the animation of the fire in the open fireplace, the small flowing stream and the movement in general, elegantly show that we have an often overlooked treasure from the past. Even those who are aware of the strong influence on many Japanese animators of the late 1930s (Disney) and subsequent decades cannot deny that this is an altogether beautiful animation. It took a few more years, but in the 1960s, manga artist, animator and film producer Osamu Tezuka modified many of the techniques used in Disney cartoons, sparking a veritable manga/anime revolution. Not to be misunderstood: Osamu-san liked Walt Disney's cartoons. But he was the pioneer who set a new trend in the Japanese manga and anime industry. He was the inventor of the distinctive 'big eyes' style of Japanese animation. But that's another story. Sorry, I got a bit carried away.Sound: good BGM, no VA (7/10)There are no dubbed voices, but gesticulating and facial expressions make the whole story easy to understand. The musical arrangements by Kojun, Saito and Takanobu, Ito evoke the appropriate emotions in the audience. Even when no words are spoken, the intention of the plot is well understood.The anime is a little treasure that, simply put, tells a story about ""it is blessed to give rather than take"". Watch the anime to the end, I am sure you will enjoy it.Thank you for reading and have fun watching!";Recommended
1;Kuroi Kikori to Shiroi Kikori;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;10;"""The Black Woodcutter and the White Woodcutter"" is the first Japanese animated film that resembles what one would associate hand drawn animation with today. With a washed out watercolor palette, a very Disney oriented art style, and a folk tale inspired story, this film encapsulates a moralistic theme of sharing and looking out for one another in hard times.The film's themes are heavily contextualized by the time it released to the public. 1956 Japan was a time of great upheaval. The Occupation years had just ended and the country was at crossroads of economic development. Poverty, hunger and loss were still widespread in the Island nation - and the post war period had led to the rise o the ""lost generation"". It was a period of hardship and also a collapse in the self confidence of the Japanese in their nationalistic ideals.The moral of this movie is pretty clear - hard times are easier passed together in the strength of unity. Scheming against one's own neighbors and participants in a common struggle would be the cause of downfall. This children's tale is pretty simple, but the manner in which it is told - stoic, almost peaceful and calming renders it a gravitas that makes its themes endure well past the time it was produced for.The technical quality of the animation also makes a giant leap with this film. Almost all modern hand drawn animation and storyboarding techniques that we would consider part of the animator's toolkit can be seen at play here. The enhancement of visual color also introduces a depth and realism into the art that captures a broad veneer of verisimilitude.";Recommended

Sad to say others would rather help them selves rather than others during times of troubles. While there is some benefit to that there is some benefit against it as well. As the story plays out one finds the moral of the story that there is strength in numbers. A good kind hearted message. The only downside to the film is it is based on hunters. I would say more but that says enough without ruining the story.ArtTwo my knowledge there are two versions of this animation. There is a moderately colorized and an a high definition colorized version. Noting the difference between the two is easy. I recommend seeing the non high definition version. Personally, i feel high definition doesn't mix well with old art. Not only that but to force modern technology on older technology defeats the purpose for what it stands for.CharacterDemonstrates individual personality.EnjoymentWhile i already admitted that this story is kind hearted with it is message it is also perplexing as well. There is at least two takes one could have on this film. The other being the act of learning wasn't done. For example kids will touch a burning stove even though they know it will hurt. In this case a pointless cycle is kept. Despite the perplexing character decisions i suggest watching this animation. While the story did not quite do a good job at illustration keep in mind there is two hunters. This is not a piece where time progresses and it is the same hunter just older.;Recommended

0;Nine 2: Koibito Sengen;Catalano;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Catalano;7;"Koibito Sengen is the second part of the Nine trilogy, it aired on TV in December 1983, that's why it was made in 4:3 ratio, so I guess it's sort of a downgrade from Original-ban visually wise. Do we even have enough time in one hour to explore the love triangles and baseball rivalries set in the first movie? Of course not, that's why we have the third special but this part definitely answers some questions.In the first movie we met our characters, we found out about their goals, we got entangled in some complicated love triangles, Seishu didn't go to Koushien and Yukimi doesn't know if Katsuya loves her or not yet she continues to go after him, everything is as hazy as a fog in a cold January evening. Now this special is set on resolving the relationship between Yukimi and Katsuya and it does it in style. And yes, you read that right, Yukimi is the main character while Yuri is just the team manager.Some may be very surprised, as in why is Yukimi so important? wasn't she just a plot device to get mingled between Katsuya and Yuri so that we the watchers would get angry? In this way, the manga can be longer and more ""dramatic"" romance scenes could happen, Yukimi will be tossed aside the moment Katsuya develops some guts and confesses to his true love, why do we even need a movie with a side character and worst of all, she's the love rival.These questions don't really need an answer because the creator knows how to make a story in order to entertain the reader/watcher and take him by surprise, forget any basic love story plot you have ever watched, Koibito Sengen is totally different with subverting the expectations while managing to keep the characters in their usual cliche behaviors. Illogical as I may sound, it makes perfect sense when you follow the romance and what the characters are doing when they are together alone, what are they talking about and what are their feelings. It's so different than the fist part it feels like a different anime, in my opinion, this can also be watched as a stand alone, we meet the important characters in the beginning, we find out it's about baseball and we easily find out about the love triangle. Then the show finishes resolving Yukimi's point of view story as a true romantic movie.The show has some baseball in the beginning, even the old rivalry between Bunan and Seishu is explored with a match but it's main point is Yukimi-Katsuya couple and what will come of it. I loved that I can finally see in anime a love story explored like that. To use examples while not being too spoilery: Yukimi will get tired of Katsuya's indecisiveness and start asking questions, a new guy Yamanaka Jirou (the little brother of Bunan High star pitcher) makes advances on her (because why not, she's cute), Katsuya will stop acting like a coward and tell Yukimi his true feelings. No misunderstandings, no random metaphors added because it looks cool, no sudden silence and the rejected acting like ""no... you don't have to tell me... I already know who you love..."", nothing garbage like that, only pure and unadulterated high school romance with clear answers and developments.To defend my rationale about the importance of Yukimi, keep in mind that we went to her house back in the first movie, we met her grandma and now we get to know her date of birth, stuff that doesn't happen with Yuri (so I guess she always was an important character). Take it as it is, it's a Yukimi special for Yukimi fans, I think the most of romance fans will be entertained about the events that transpired here, the sports fans and Yuri fans may not like it though which is understandable.To keep the story more complicated, a new guy is introduced, Yamanaka Jirou, who loves Yukimi but the watcher should not be fooled, he's not the usual delinquent dude added in to make the main guy look better, Jirou actually has a story (decently written and interesting) and his feelings for her are genuine. What will happen with these three is up to the watcher to find out but the important thing is that we get a clear ending, so clear that it made me think that the story ended and part 3 doesn't exist, I actually forgot about Yuri and big brother Yamanaka and thought that this was a shoujo anime with Yukimi in between Jirou (who loves her) and Katsuya (who loves someone else but he may have feelings for Yukimi).Nothing much about the art and animation, it's the same as Original-ban only 4:3, the characters and the baseball games look the same, stale and bland, nothing too extraordinary to feast our eyes. The soundtrack is just as cool as ever though, great songs to listen to if you like the 80s music.In the end, Koibito Sengen managed to be a very good romance movie set in high school, following our guys from the same Seishu Baseball Club we met in the first part. Unfortunately, Yuri and Yamanaka Kentarou are tossed aside as important characters in order to make room for Katsuya-Yukimi-Jirou story. It looks like a filler so that we can go on with the true ending of part 3 when we will hopefully get the final answer about Yuri and Katsuya, and also... will Seishu finally go to Koushien?";Recommended

Her answer seemed to have been considered as one that a child could understand, but something about the way she phrased it really freaked me out, and I've often thought back on the misconception I had about that story over the years.As an adult, once I was able to examine my disturbed reaction, I found that to my understanding, it was a story about some men who are forced into the pursuit of something they don't understand. Travelling in spirals, in ever tightening concentric circles, driven by madness or lust or fear into smaller and more bizarre rooms until they eventually found themselves trapped in a singularity. I couldn't know if what they found there was a profound truth or a cruel emptiness.Ito offers no answers, but he does retell that journey with uncanny resemblance.;Recommended
0;Spacy;inim;https://myanimelist.net/profile/inim;6;"TL;DR Uncanny experimental short exploring space, time and movement in innovative ways. It's done using drawings and executed well.Story: The movie shows rapid camera movements in a gym. The camera moves and zooms into pictures of other gyms (placed on poles), and by this jumps into a new space. The angles, speed, movement directions in the gym before the next jump, forward and backward movements, colors and smoothness of the animation change over time. Camera movement starts slow, choppy, blue, and calm with few jumps. Then it evolves into fast movement, many jumps, flashing, red and yellowish, backwards and downwards. The animation ends with a still of a man in front of a wall, putting movement options to a halt. 7/10.Art: The art is good, especially given this was made in 1981. The shapes used are all simple rectangular geometries, so CGI would have greatly helped with it. Hand drawing this effect in 1981 was pretty visionary. The level of detail is not over-boarding but it is better than average, e.g. the floors have visible structures where you could just have done flat grading. The scenes are color graded, with muddy blues, sepias, and reds. This again anticipates effects which only became widely and easily available much later with advances in CGI. 8/10.Sound: Electronic noise style music supports the unsettling effect of the movement very well. Intensity increases over time, greatly contributing to the feeling of building tension. 4/10.Character: Space and movement themselves are the actors, not humans. Space is special, so I give it a multiple of the rate normal space would get, one for each spacetime dimension. 4/10.Enjoyment: Quite a bit, it's MC Escher the short experimental animation. Glad I watched this on a computer monitor only, not on a larger TV set. Leave a lone a VR headset, which must melt your brain. Of course there is no plot in the traditional sense, but the zoom effect along with colors and music directly attacks your brain's sense of reality. When was the last time you questioned space-time itself? After this movie, you do. It literally creates a few new neurons in places reality never would. 8/10Overall rating: The short has a limited scope, which is to tease the brain with space and movement it is not used to. It completely achieves this. The whole endeavor anticipates cinematic techniques which became widely used only much later with the advance of CGI and color grading. However, it clearly has limits in that it has no real plot, no characters, and is pretty much a one-trick pony. It however resonates with me and I am sure I will remember it long after watching. This makes it an above average experimental short, which is 6/10 for me. (7+8+4+4+8+6)/6=6.16Edit: Typos and grammar.";Mixed Feelings

It's an experimental video, but also one of the first Avante Garde expressions of a video in a time when every drawn video was some kind of cartoon with cartoon characters. The video also simulates three dimensions, a unique depart from the two-dimensional (2.5 dimensional) nature of every other hand-drawn video at the time.In short, this video was not made for your entertainment, it was made to push the boundaries of animation, which it did (hence how it won 1st place at the St. Teccian Cup). Complaining about how it's ""not enjoyable hence the low rating"" is like saying ""broccoli is a bad food because it's not sweet."" It's using a very insular scope of defining what's good.Not to mention, the video is a SILENT FILM from THE 30s! Who in the right mind would complain that a silent film has no sound?";Recommended

0;Pig: Oka no Ue no Dam Keeper;Eisigerhauch;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eisigerhauch;9;Pig: Oka no Ue no Dam Keeper features a colourful world brim with symbolism and creative morphing of the function of things. Beautiful sound effects and extraordinary arrangements of classical instruments accompany the visual story-telling that deals with concepts of basic needs. The anthropomorphism contrasts stark elements of an inhuman normative narration.We explore this world that has a lovely blend of the familiar that meets the strange in often unexpecting ways. The story itself is one of coming of age, dealing with the harshness and all the wonders that life throws at you. The animation is simplistic and fluid, contributing to the atmosphere that reminds me of children's books, fairy tales, autumn breezes, a crackling fireplace and fables of old.Each episode introduces a new conflict that gets resolved in a manner that foreshadows the next and progresses the overarching narrative. The contrast of warmth and harshness in these conflicts is outstanding, and the pig with all Its clumsy movements, little sounds, gazes, and sighs is relatable in its yearning and motivation. All the gestures and details provide the cast with charming qualities.I highly recommend Pig: Oka no Ue no Dam Keeper and hope that every viewer who might shed a tear or two will feel entranced by the rewarding glimpse into the little pig's world and its delights.;Recommended

The animation is really really cute, and the music video's story is absolutely what makes it worth it.In short, the video is about a human boy who seemed to be contemplating suicide, and a demon boy who was out on the run from two demon officials who were trying to rope him back into slavery. No spoilers, but if you watch it, you should pause it at 2:43 to read the letter for a bit more context over the reaction of the two at the end.Overall, I enjoyed it. The visual storytelling is superb and does a great job in the flashback scenes in regards to the pink triangle placed around the demon's neck, especially if you know what that symbolized in history (it was placed around the necks of homosexuals during WII). It was shown I think only twice, but when taking that into consideration with his reactions in the human world and some of the scenes with the other demon in the picture, it's even easier to appreciate the story that much more.I'd recommend it because for 1, it's short and cute, and 2, whether or not you like the music, it definitely has a nice style to it that I feel like should be appreciated for the work that went into it.;Mixed Feelings

Normally anime for me falls within four categories:art, subbed, dubbed, and music. This anime fell in three as you can see above. Reason being is within this anime the director decided to make a show based on the works from young amateurs from japan as well as the USA. Knowing that you can decided on ""what's your choice?"".StoryI like the idea that kids actually played into the fact of this art. Even if they were just responsible for the original drawing of the characters. Having their involvement is not only a nice gesture by the staff but a true kids film made by kids for kids.Also, this story revolved on a good morale or life lesson. No matter where you live as an adult choices must be made. Some are based on pain(necessity) others are based on norm(unneeded). For example choosing to buy food vs a television. One hand hours and hours of entertainment. On the other hand you get to live another day.ArtGiven how the work was based from the art of kids it wasn't that bad.

0;Nisou no Kuzu;sodomized;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sodomized;6;At it's core, Nisou no Kuzu is riddled with dialectical shifts. It follows 2 submerged individuals, man and a woman, in what is seemingly a couple quarrel. This is where objective evaluation stops as we're evidently left to interpret it however we want. Ultimately, I was left with an impression that it's nothing but a clash of 2 contrasting standpoints. Seeds, fishes, thorns, eggs, ants are serving as instruments of conversation. I don't see them being metaphors for anything in specific.Subtle nuances in it's narrative are nothing short of confusing, which is most noticeable during it's closure. It's story is filled with details, photo-realistic art is fitting and so are the simple but crisp animations. The evocative sound effects really added up to Nisou no Kuzu's surrealist approach, which I found to be one of the main strengths of this short movie.If you're looking for something to chew on then this is right down your alley.

0;Kuroi Ame ni Utarete;Gay4Pay;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gay4Pay;6;"From Nakazawa Keiji, the creator of Hadashi no Gen (Barefoot Gen) and Kuro ga Ita Natsu (Summer with Kuro). Kuroi Ame ni Utarete (Beaten by the Black Rain) follows first and second generation survivors of the Hiroshima bombing. It's easily Nakazawa Keiji's most resentful film.The characters in this movie have a very low opinion of Americans, and the director doesn't project a flattering depiction of Americans. The characters have no outlet for all of the negative emotions they experience, so they try to get revenge on oblivious tourists by saying and doing reprehensible things. They're acutely aware of how irrational and unfair they're being; they can't move on from their experiences due to heavy discrimination against atom bomb survivors.Ultimately this movie is the manifestation of all the pent-up bitterness and resentment that atom bomb survivors had for the inescapable circumstances that surrounded them in post WWII Japan. The Japanese government and the Japanese people failed them, and Americans were oblivious to their struggles. It's a bit of a downer, to say the least. The movie doesn't vilify or justify the actions of its characters. It leaves judgment up to the viewer. Some of these people behave terribly, some try to move on, and several of them die regardless of what they were doing.It's a polarizing movie. Some people will appreciate it, most people will see it as a pointlessly hateful and ugly movie. I'd recommend seeing it despite any preconceptions you might have. If nothing else, this movie has convinced me that atom bombs are far more destructive than we think they are, and they have ruined far more lives than Wikipedia gives them credit for. The purpose of this movie is to showcase the terrible things atom bombs can do in the hope that we never resort to them again, and I think it succeeds in that endeavor.";Mixed Feelings
0;Kuroi Ame ni Utarete;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;4;"Overview:Beaten by the Black Rain isn't a well known anime, but it should be. This very well might be the most disappointing anime sequel I've ever seen. One of my favorite anime films of all time is a 1983 anti-War film called Barefoot Gen. I think it's vastly superior to Grave of the Fireflies and I will readily defend it as an unfairly overlooked classic. Black Rain is the sequel to Gen made by the same writer/director just 1 year later. This anime is just fucking baffling! It takes EVERYTHING that Gen did right and does it wrong! WHY Mr. Nakazawa?! Why would you do this?!Pros:This anime deals with the discrimination faced by survivors of the atomic bombings. These bombing victims were constantly, wrongly treated as if they were dangerously radioactive and shunned by much of Japanese society. That's a tragic but unexplored area in anime that could have led to an interesting film. Sadly, that isn't the path this film goes on.The anime deals with the lasting psychological scars left by the air raids and atomic bombings. The author, Keiji Nakazawa, said he wanted to release his pent up anger, frustration, and hopelessness onto the page. The long lasting psychological impact of historical injustice is also a topic rich for exploration. The American novelist Toni Morrison has done great work in that area for example.Cons:All the problems with this anime basically fit into 2 major areas. Firstly, the Americans are so cartoonishly demonized and portrayed as SO 1 dimensional that it becomes a joke. The other major issue is that this film takes place in the 1980s and not 1945, yet all Japanese and American characters in the entire film hate each other like the war is still ongoing!Rather than summarize the whole plot about an anger filled bartender and his experiences with evil American tourists, I'm just going to give you the film's highlights.1. American tourists show up at Hiroshima to mock the Japanese and celebrate how many people the bomb killed. Another American tourist shows up to take pictures of some physically deformed people born after the bomb and mock their handicaps. I would be ASTOUNDED if Nakazawa actually encountered American tourists in Hiroshima that behaved this way. Maybe James Allsup and Logan Paul went on a Bill and Ted adventure, traveled back to the early 80s, and that's who Nakazawa encountered. Even then, certainly not an accurate portrayal of average Americans.2. An American runs into a bar with a revolver and shoots at the ceiling while screaming ""Japs! You are the uppity!"" This raises several questions. Firstly, how the fuck did this drunk get that revolver past Japanese airport security? Secondly, why does Nakazawa think Americans talk like Starfire in Teen Titans Go?! This movie is the stupid, the boring, and the hateful.3. A prostitute sleeps with American tourists to give them syphilis and fantasizes about how painfully they will die. This film takes place in the 80s, when syphilis could be cured with a basic penicillin shot!4. Another prostitute refuses to sleep with an American sex tourist because of the atomic bombings. The American than rapes her while screaming ""America Strong! America always win!"" I have no further comments. It's just a laughably stupid scene.5. An American vagabond randomly breaks into a bar in Hiroshima and tries to rob the place. The bartender ninja kicks the gun out of the American's hand and strangles him with his bare hands. ""You fat pigs can't fight without your guns!"" he shouts in triumph. Suddenly, the American pops back up like Jason Vorhees and stabs our MC in the back while screaming ""Rememba Pear Haba! America Revenge!""Overall:On the one hand, this is made by a survivor of the atomic bombs and he's simply trying to get his anger out and do some self therapy. On the other hand, Nakazawa didn't just keep this as a rough draft in some diary. He released this piece of shit to a global audience and completely undermined the masterpiece he made just 1 year prior! This movie is hysterically bad, but then you feel horrible for laughing. The art and production value is strong. Someone REALLY had faith in this movie...for some reason. I went easy on this movie by even giving it a 4, mostly because I felt bad for Nakazawa. If you looking for classic anime that time forgot, PLEASE don't see this one!";Not Recommended

0;Phantom Yuusha Densetsu;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;1;Phantom Yuusha Densetsu is a short film OVA from the early 90s. It was produced by Magic Bus. That's right, the same producer as Dragoon & one of the studios that worked on Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu. I have to say, that's immediately not promising but maybe this one has the quality those two lacked. Probably not, but it's possible.Story:We open with our protagonist, I don't give a shit what his name is, being contacted by his also boring friend about a Phantom jet sighting in El Salvador. Since Don't Care, is an ex JASDF pilot, he seems like the ideal choice to examine it for a report. Because you definitely need first hand jet flying experience to report on a jet sighting. It's not like Journalism experience is useful for that. In any case, Don't Care agrees to go with his friend's camera man and things quickly turn bad as he finds himself entwined in a conspiracy where multiple government agents want him dead. The biggest issue with this film is that, like the stratagems of Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu, it suffers from a lot of blatant idiocy. Having an ex pilot with no Journalism experience go to do investigative journalism is pretty stupid. A government agency surreptitiously selling one of their jets without erasing their markings is really stupid. The antagonists capturing the hero they're trying to kill, having him drugged and at their mercy and then not killing him is just egregiously stupid. It might be acceptable in a piece of media for children, but this is pretty blatantly for adults. Keep in mind, this film lasts for just under an hour and manages to have all these substantial plot holes. There's also an underlying plot about the CIA trying to stop everyone from finding out they're interfering with El Salvador. Which I don't get. Granted, I'm not an expert in American politics, but I know that the US has a long, long history of mucking about with Central American countries. Would there really be that much of an outrage from the citizens because they were caught doing it yet again?Characters: The characters barely have personalities worth mentioning. Don't care is one of those intense macho heroes with no real personality. The villains are just sleazy and evil for no adequately explored reason. The girlfriend is there to show her tits, be assaulted and die to give Don't Care some motivation. She's the only female character too, unless you count the naked woman who shows up for five seconds. So, the character writing is just shit. Art: This isn't one of those anime that hasn't aged that well. That would imply that it was passable or even good for its time. It wasn't. Even for the early 90s, this animation is bad. They use a lot of tricks to try to make it seem like there's more movement than there actually is, but even with the strobe effect and such, it's really painfully obvious that there was very little effort put into the animation. The movements are very minimum and janky when they do happen. The characters just look very boring in terms of design and the sex scenes are really bad. Not because of the crass nature thereof, the poor animation work and generally rubbish art just make for really bad sex scenes. Sound: The acting isn't very good. It doesn't even rise to mediocrity. The actors may be fine under other circumstances but this is one of those works where the lack of character depth combined with poor direction really makes for poor performances. The music is just dull but still the best aspect of the work. Ho-yay:There is none. Truthfully, I prefer not to see ho-yay in a work this bad any way. Because they never do it well. Areas of Improvement: Develop your plot. A lot of these problems could be handled with some actual effort. For example, have our main character be an actual journalist, maybe one who used to be a pilot. Then it would make sense for him to be sent. You could also have him find documentation about where they got their Phantoms from, thereby eliminating the tell-tale markings. And have him captured, being taken to a remote spot for clandestine elimination and just wake up and escape. Character complexity. You don't need as many characters as this has as long as you actual give yours some compelling traits. Have an animation budget higher than half the budget of an old Scooby Doo episode. Because this just looks terrible. Final Thoughts:This one deserves to languish in obscurity. It's pretty damn horrendous. Every major plot point is riddled with stupidity induced holes. It looks bad, sounds bad and the characters are trash. I'm giving this one a 1/10. It's awful. ;Not Recommended

1;Tsuru ni Notte: Tomoko no Bouken;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;7;The thing about anime is that it covers a whole variety of genres, and you never know what you'll find. I literally just discovered this movie, On A Paper Crane: Tomoko's Adventure, today, and surprisingly, it was a lot easier to find than I thought, though that was because I knew where to look. It's a short OVA about a little girl, Tomoko, who visits Hiroshima and goes to a museum about the atomic bombing of the city. Although appalled by what she sees, namely the bombing reconstructions, she has a great time. When she sees a statue depicting a girl holding up a paper crane, Tomoko makes a crane out of a candy wrapper, and to her surprise, the girl from the statue, Sadako, magically comes to life and tells Tomoko about the war. The two of them become fast friends, though their friendship doesn't last very long because...well, anyone who knows about Japanese post-war history know that Sadako, who is basically Sadako Sasaki, technically died at 12 years old because of radiation exposure from the bomb.War movies tend to be hit-or-miss for some. Many of them, with the right writing and execution, can turn out great, while others wind up being cheesy, bad, disingenuous, or outright insulting, again, depending on the staff behind them. Most of them aren't the most faithful to the facts (*coughMichaelBay'sPearlHarborcough*), or some try to use the war as a backdrop for something else. On a Paper Crane keeps its scope fairly small, focusing on a child going to a museum and having a magical adventure with the ghost of a dead girl. The animation is mostly fine, as the character designs are fairly realistic and not very cartoony, namely with the characters' eyes being small and not overly big and sparkly, and the way they animate debris flying through the air when the bomb is dropped is very lusciously done. It helps that the background art is well drawn and the movie doesn't skimp on the details of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park's monuments, particularly on one particular building Tomoko and Sadako visit. Though since this movie was made in 1993, the park was very different back then compared to how it looks now. The music isn't much to write home about other than consisting of mostly cheesy piano tunes making their corresponding scenes come across as more syrupy than they should. The song at the end is nice, though.On a Paper Crane centers on just two main characters, who while not receiving much in the way of development, do have good chemistry and bounce off of each other pretty well. Tomoko is a realistic, well-meaning kid who is naive to the harsh realities of war, and Sadako is...mostly just there to exposit about the war and her own experiences with it. The movie is only 27 minutes long, so they don't really change much throughout the course of that run time except for Tomoko becoming more aware of not only what happened during the bomb dropping, but of Sadako's situation. But while I understand that this movie has good intentions, I really don't think portraying Sadako Sasaki, a real person, as a magical ghost girl who takes her modern day friend on a magical crane and flying around the world was the best idea. Doing that just felt ingenuous, mainly because Sadako is just there to be an exposition dump. I think maybe this movie would work better if Tomoko not only visited the museum and saw Sadako's statue, but read the book that Sadako's brother put out about her life, and maybe make the movie about Sadako's life as Tomoko reads it in the novel. I mean, Japan has made anime movies about WWII survivors before, like Ushiro no Shoumen Daare and The Glass Rabbit (Though I still think the former is better). Now, the only reason I even know about Sadako Sasaki's story is because I bought and read the short book about her put out by Eleanor Coerr back in 1977, which is a more fictionalized take on her life. While I can somewhat understand what On a Paper Crane was trying to do, but the way it told its story just came across as really cheesy, treacly, and overly sentimental for my liking.To my knowledge, On a Paper Crane did get a very limited VHS release (I couldn't find information on whether this was a US release or elsewhere), even having an English dub, surprisingly enough, which is the version I just saw. But I'm not gonna lie, the English dub...isn't bad, per se, but a lot of the acting could get really hammy and cheesy. Sadako's voice actress in particular just sounded really stiff and stilted, like she was just reading off a script, particularly when she's expositing about the war. But I've heard worse dubs, so On a Paper Crane's dub isn't the worst dub I've ever heard. As far as I know, it never got an official subtitled release. If you're interested in watching this though, I only know of one website where you can watch it, both the dubbed version and the Japanese version without subtitles. PM me for details. So, in conclusion, while I wouldn't call this one of the better World War II-themed movies, it's serviceable enough and has its heart in the right place, but be prepared for a lot of cheese.;Recommended
0;Een;eblf2013;https://myanimelist.net/profile/eblf2013;6;Een was an interesting clip to watch to say at least, its message was, although weird, it was well delivered.Okay, I LOVED the animation way more than I expected, the vibrancy, the transitions, the synchronization with the crying and the expresiveness of all of it was absolutely superb... I'd consider it great if it weren't because it had literally THE WORST sound a human could hear, a baby crying, seriously, it was utterly annoying to hear, fortunately, it's just a minute long so nothing much of value was lost. Artists have really a good potential and I'd like to see more works of them actually, as long as it doesn't involve A FREAKING BABY CRYING OUT LOUD.;Mixed Feelings
0;Genroku Koi Moyou: Sankichi to Osayo;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;5;The years of Genroku are generally considered to be the Golden Age of the Edo period. The previous hundred years of peace and seclusion in Japan had created relative economic stability. The arts and architecture flourished. In this setting, we come across Sankichi, a wandering vagabond who might have once been a samurai and his desire to impress the lady who thinks he is a coward for having (potentially) surviving despite the passing of his feudal lord.I'm giving this a higher grade solely for how remarkably well it has been preserved in comparison to works of similar Japanese peerage, which makes it a good entry for someone looking to get a taste of the Japanese animation scene in the 30s to dip their toes into.There are some oblique references to war - with the bird squadron trying to take down the big bad bandit, but anything else is a reach. This just seems to be a simple self contained story about a man chasing for love, saving the woman he wants to impress and gaining her favor.;Mixed Feelings
0;Genroku Koi Moyou: Sankichi to Osayo;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;3;Rate a 3English SubtiledNo soundStoryNot much of one, more simple if anything. In terms of introduction there was promise. Artwork conveyed a lovely display of romantic affection. The main character's main problem was discussed. Although, midway or for the most part of the film that is when the movie became rather confusing or dropped. At one point there is a person roaming the street with unfortunate news but the art and story seems to have ignored that complete and went with a side story where the action was the opposite. Then you have the evil character come into play. He hears of this unfortunate news (which surprisingly may not have been done by his orders) and decides to act out what seems to be a random or spur of the moment plan. As for the ending it related back to the introduction and had a kindhearted conclusion. Had it not been for that kind of ending where it was not only kind but related back to the story i would have been tempted to give out a 2 or 1. What really killed this anime was not the plot nor the sound(or completely lack of) but the art.ArtArt was far to bright. There were tons of obvious animation loops. Too many unrealistic cartoonist comedy used. Such as the complete slice scene. Ribs, we all have them. Well, aside from him i guess.;Not Recommended
0;Xiao Men Shen;Yemi_Hikari;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yemi_Hikari;8;I can't deny falling in love with this particular piece - in fact, as I write the review I am watching the movie a second time, nor do I think this will be the last. Even more specifically, part of the draw for this particular movie comes from the fact when you talk about quality 3D animated movies for children, the two studios which come to mind are Pixar and DreamWorks, yet this - this piece is not from a Western company, yet is exactly what one is looking for, although I do wish the Western version didn't get trimmed down. Said studio has the potential to find itself up there with those two, much like how Studio Ghibli in being a known name, yet even more interesting - this studio isn't from Japan - it's a Chinese studio.The movie utilizes Chinise mythology - that of the door gods, or guardian spirits, which may not be well known to Westerners watching the series, but the moral lies into accepting change and that while not all change is good, some is, but there's a bit against big business stepping on the small business which will resonate even in the West. The main characters are quite lovable, but this makes for a great find for those interested in something for the family.;Recommended

0;Chang Jian Feng Yun;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;6;Long Sword recounts the plight of oppressed Easterners at the hands of a foreign occupation in Sack City, where law enforcement is discriminatory and people are left to fend for themselves or become bandits for food rations. It's perhaps the most realistic take on asymmetric political power, undoubtedly inspired by China's colonial past and projected into a post-apocalyptic future. It's a world where rape, harassment, and being gunned down by the police for no reason is expected.The story follows He Jiang, a woman who follows in the footsteps of her father, a trucker, who is shot at a traffic stop 7 years ago, their load robbed, and her thrown in prison. It is said that somehow she manages to fend off every single rape attempt. Back in society, she gets no respite, as there's no place for a woman besides being a prostitute. So she tries to carve a space out for herself and her race.Long Sword had all the markings of a masterpiece, from the dark, gritty realism, to the hard-hitting social commentary. You won't find any Geass, titans, mecha, or idealistic warlords here. All there is are desert, common thugs, misogynists, and petty corrupt officers. In other words, this is more Fallout and less Bladerunner.It is unfortunate, however, that this show has the most unrealistic fight choreography of all time, one that greatly diminishes the realism at key moments, that turn what should have been inspiring Braveheart underdog moments into a joke. In one scene, characters who are beaten on the back of a head with lead pipes get up like nothing happens. In others, steroids-injecting muscle-heads get thrown around like rag dolls by people half their sizes, or are able to pull out guns while on the ground being grappled. In the final conflict, a police blockade brings carbon fiber shields but no gun (despite that they regularly have guns throughout the show), an officer that has a gun becomes uncharacteristically afraid to shoot, and the blockade gets easily overrun by the first resistance.The first half of the season sets up a great potential and gets all the pieces in order. Then the floor collapses under it with poor execution, and it's too bad, because no other anime -- Chinese or Japanese -- matches it. It's the closest thing to an adult-oriented HBO show, but animated (3D).I rarely comment on sound, but I will note two things: The theme tune has a whistle that's annoyingly similar to the Red XIII theme in FF7, and the ED is a rap song where the bilingual Chinese-English rapper tries his hardest to sound like Tupac/Scarface. It's kind of funny.;Mixed Feelings

Shows nudity as well implied sexual acts.2. Quite a few amount of flashes in the art and used as transitions.StoryA film meant for feedback and interpretation. My take was a rather dirty take. Not that my mind is completely filthy i just presently don't see a cleaner take for the moment. A sentiment to how one's deeper or inner thoughts are on beating one's self up for not satisfying oneself. I did warn you.The conclusion wasn't that better but than again i think it does speak true to a lot of people. Ending referring to instant regret and fear.ArtHad this film not been used in a psychiatrist fashion with ink blots maybe this film could have more deeper meaning. For starters it would make most artwork clearer.Also, could have done with out the constant repeats or segment loops. I understand repetition or elongating an act allows for more clarity but it does more harm than good. For starters the artwork images are professional. They aren't for a professional setting. Their contrast levels are quite high. And when you toss in the morphing aspect it becomes frustrating.Overall: If the goal was to make one disturbed or irritated than mission accomplished. Although, that view or regard carries such a negative attribute. Which is why i focus mostly on plot for with plot good or bad can carry a useful tool. Sadly, like i mentioned before plot is up to viewer. While it is true porn or sex remains on one's mind having that show as a majority chunk is a complete lie. We have bills to pay, we have kids to care for, one could have a spouse, activities to name a few. All of which takes time and patience. Lastly, what point could positively be gained from this film? Porn has a big impact on one lives? I think that we all should know that. Why else do you think we think provocative remarks, words, language in commercials, books and other common functions? For it sells. Always has always will.;Not Recommended

0;Yousei Land Mukashibanashi;Lancehot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lancehot;5;When we left the Furious Fairy Five, the show had overcome some of its more egregious technical issues but still hadn't figured out what it wanted to be. Fortunately, there is a simple solution to not knowing what to do: do classic folk-tales. Forest Fairy Five ~Fairy Tale~ presents us with the fairies spin on three well known legends - Tsuru no Ongaeshi, Momotarō & Urashimako – before the forest fairies themselves have to travel through the settings of these stories to rescue Mai from...her insecurities, I guess.Surprisingly, given what a janky mess FFF was, it kinda works. Gone is the sense that the show is desperately scrambling around for ideas, replaced by what at times feels like a folktale version of Funky Forest or Peeping Life. Each retelling combines elements of other folktales, as well as some of the writers own strange ideas & at times were genuinely amusing – for instance Issun-boshi's girlfriend sulking that he can't do the wall push to her (Issun-boshi is one inch tall). No doubt some – or many – will find it excruciatingly boring (much like Funky Forest & Peeping Life), but it's still a marked improvement on what came before.As is the shows production. While still janky as heck, FFF's look has reached the point where you can just take its weird & low quality animations & camerawork as part of the shows aesthetic. The character models themselves have improved notably &, perhaps even more importantly, the sound engineer seems to have figured out how to use their mixing desk. While the VA's themselves still have a habit of speaking too close to the microphone, in all it's still leagues ahead of where the show started.Which is what is part of the charm of FFF – the equivalent perhaps of watching a game go from pre-alpha to final release (well, maybe Early Access). While I'd never call it good, it's been weirdly fascinating to watch this strange show that had no reason to exist outside of some dark corner of Nico Nico (it aired on Tokyo MX1!) but also seems to have been made by people who genuinely were trying to make a real show & kept trying to improve it throughout. If nothing else, it makes a nice change to see a production get better rather than deteriorate over its run time. Not that anyone would think to watch past the first episode.On that note, if you couldn't stomach the first season of FFF, give this one a shot. The folk-tale stories & “improved” look really do make a surprising difference. & while you still have to put up with (or skip) that needlessly long 2-3minute intro to each episode, this time I'd almost say it's worth it. I don't know what they were thinking then they decided to make this series, but I'm kind of glad they did.;Mixed Feelings

But as I said, the animation is adulterous, and Lupin was only like that in a few serials, so that can put a few people off.It's enjoyable by itself, and for Lupin fans it's great fun to look at.;Recommended

0;Meisou-Ou Border;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;4;Meisou-ou Border is a forty five minute OVA from '91. It's based off of a Caribu Marley manga and was brought to life by Artland. That's right, the studio behind such pieces of complete tripe as Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu and Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou. But they also did Mushishi and Gunslinger Girl Il Teatrino, so we can't assume the worst. Story:We open with two blokes living in filth in a sketchy flat complex being hired to do a job. Since it's good money and they're incredibly stupid, they don't think to ask what the job actually is before taking it. From there the plot just meanders. Therein lies the big problem with this OVA. There's some build up leading to their job but the actual work ends in five minutes and, after that, it's just these idiots faffing about for the second half of the OVA. Even the job doesn't get resolved well. There's never a point where anything really engaging, funny or interesting happens. Which makes watching this roughly equivalent to staring at your wall. You probably won't be too bothered by doing it but you also won't gain anything from it. Characters:I'm just going to refer to our protagonists as young scruffy guy and old shabby guy. Yeah, I could take ten seconds to look at their names, but I don't care enough. Scruffy is one of those protagonists who's an amicable, well-intentioned slob. Shabby is more the hedonistic, cheapskate but good on the inside type. They're both incredibly stupid and we get the same problem with them as we have with the narrative in general. They're just devoid of anything noteworthy or compelling. You could replace them with stray dogs on an adventure with no dialogue and at least the dogs would be cute which would make them better. Art:In terms of artwork and animation, it doesn't look bad. It's not the world's most polished looking work, but it's fine. And that's, unfortunately, the highest praise I can give any element of this OVA. The worst part of the artwork is the character design. A lot of the major dudes who show up are just these kind of generic looking mangy guys. So, a lot of it ends up looking the same. It's kind of like Marvel's old GI Joe comics with clean cut blonde, blue-eyed dudes you can't differentiate at a glance. Except that those gave them distinct outfits and these guys all dress similarly too. Maybe Caribu just likes having generic mangy guys as characters as much as I like writing LGBT characters. Sound: The main characters are voiced by Yara Yuusaku & Horiuchi Kenyuu. Their performances aren't particularly impressive but they're perfectly passable. I've heard better performances from both of them in the past, but those were in series where they were doing things that warranted range. The music is entirely forgettable. It's all just rather generic. Ho-yay:There isn't any on display. Areas of Improvement:Focus on one story line. Part of the problem with this work is that, instead of giving us one cohesive narrative and doing it well, it gives us a mesh of thrown together, half-assed plot lines. Focusing on one story would have given it a chance to develop the conflict and characters better. Characters need personality. If you're going to waste more than half the work doing nothing, at least use that time to give the characters some complexity.Distinctive Designs. These guys looking very similar and just generic in general does not help this OVA. Even if you want to maintain the aesthetic of having them both look shabby, you can do that while also giving them more differentiated facial features. At the very least. Final Thoughts:In the end, Meisou-ou Border isn't a bad OVA. Its biggest failing comes down to one simple factor, there's nothing to it.  So, unless you need a sleep aid I can't really recommend it. I'll give it a 4/10 for being dull and tedious but inoffensive. ;Not Recommended

Just enjoying the music, which I certainly did, is more than enough motivation to watch it again. All the while understanding the story told with the visuals better on each viewing.And those extra viewings were certainly necessary to discover the meaning behind Ainone.So, what's it about? Or a more accurate question, what did I believe it to be about?The answer can already be seen by the first look we get at the main character. She's sitting on a tree, looking at a seed (of presumably the same type of tree). This is about changing over time, and about how people value you for what you are to them now, and not for what you could be.Now I'd love to go scene by scene and say what they all meant to me, but I believe this is a process that needs to be experienced, since discovering the meaning behind the story and the scenes is what makes this show so enjoyable to watch.Although there is barely any real character development, mostly due to the fact the facial expressions are very hard to read with this unique artstyle and animation, this doesn't really have any negative effects on the show.In the end (of my 20ish consecutive viewings) I (still) enjoyed listening to the song, and although I couldn't disagree with some who claimed the story was incompetently told, I quite liked it.";Recommended

But such well build base, did not take away an inch from the erotic factor, as their background came with visual stimulation (conjoining pleasurable with usefulness in one scoop)The art is good, and although there was shown no issues with the female anatomy being drawn with no censorship, the author Chose to add something else to it as the Hentai continues, by using symbolism to show certain emotions and characteristics to the body and to sensations, which are hard to portray in a simple normal drawing, yet are felt and experienced in real life.So it is known that the portrayal has a reason and is a choice, to help the viewers relate more to what is truly felt and experienced, to give a different notion, as in the beginning of the Hentai the female characters are shown in detail and with no censorship whatsoever.It does have humor, to add some lightness to quite heavier and detailed matters and situations experienced by significant characters, characters which do show the variety of people we can find in life, their different reasons, which I found outstanding - a blow of fresh air in a very stereotyped world, where we know nothing, and repeat concepts and ""hear-says"".The sound was good, made very good thanks to the dubbing.This Hentai will be added to my Favorites, as it is a first, a pioneer - a lonely pioneer.It is one of the few, possibly only, Hentais that actually has informative and formative value to all men, it shows a portrayal of nearly the actual truth - how the female body feels, how to act, what to have in consideration, how to truly pleasure a partner, and a rather fairer portrayal of a woman's biology, body, physical sensitivity.Which is not something we come across. Adult industry is merely acting, inaccurate concepts played out just for the enjoyment of the watcher, with no base on how things actually feel for a female in real life.As a result, we have ignorant fellow men, and women who truly believe there must be something wrong with themselves for not feeling pleasure out of the rough shallow and fast approach seen in the Adult Industry and Hentais of sorts.

0;Mahoutsukai Sally (Movie);ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;5;Mahoutsukai Sally is a franchise that goes way back. It started as a manga in '66. And then got turned into a Toei anime from the end of '66 to the end of '68. From there, Toei decided to revive it in the late 80s. This film was made in 1990, about midway through that run. I'll be honest, I'd  never heard of the franchise before browsing random films. So, let's take a look at its only film and see what it's about. Story:We open with a young girl dreaming about her lost birth mother. I'm sure that will have nothing to do with the events of the film. It's an unseasonably cold spring. A young girl, Sumire, calls Sally to discuss a strange picture book she's going to bring over. Probably just cutesy PharMercy pictures and completely unrelated to anything else. Don't worry about it. Sally contacts her parents, who tell her that the cause is trouble in the fairy realm. Sugar, stop playing your piccolo. You'll kill us all. Sally's parents explain that they'd investigate, but they're very busy trying to bring the spice back into their marriage before they split up to find younger partners. Actually, they can't enter because the fairy realm doesn't allow adults. She returns home to find everyone  who'd gone over is missing and there's a picture book about faeries on the table. Naturally, she gets sucked in and finds herself on a quest to save the fairy realm from a witch. The biggest issue with the film is just that everything's kept far too easy. It's like they decided that, because it's for children, there can't be any kind of credible threat. So, there are some relatively minor problems where the remedy is really simple. And it's just not compelling. I'm not asking for something grandiose or super complex from a half hour film for children but at least have something. I can't complain about it too much since it is, clearly, for young audiences and there's nothing majorly wrong with it, though. Characters:The characters don't come across as super complex, but they do seem passable given the target audience. You even get the impression that they have a little more to them than just the basic archetypes, but you don't really get to see many hints of that due to the length constraints. I appreciate that the witch has sympathetic motivations, but what they ultimately do with it is pretty mundane. Art:The art style is very much that old fashioned, kind of low effort fare with wide-eyed innocent character designs. Which is fair enough. It probably looks exactly like the anime. Unfortunately, it's not a style that has aged well. Sound:The acting is okay. You won't find Sumire listed as one of Hisakawa Aya's greatest roles. I'd be surprised if Sally was considered one of Yamamoto Yuriko's, but I've heard her in only a few very minor roles aside from this, so I can't say for certain. The music is, likewise, all right. Ho-yay:There might be some in the series, since most magical girl anime possess some level of les-yay, but if there is it doesn't come across in the film. Final Thoughts:Mahoutsukai Sally, the film is, ultimately, pretty average. It doesn't have much in terms of attention grabbing, interesting content but, for a short children's film, it works. It's inoffensive and will likely keep their attention. So, I'll give it a 5/10. Maybe at some point in future I'll watch the series proper and give a more complete picture of how that holds up. Tomorrow, I'll keep the week going with a look at the Futari wa Precure: Splash Star Movie. ;Mixed Feelings
1;Mahoutsukai Sally (Movie);Purple_Gh0st24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Purple_Gh0st24;4;"So I decided to watch the original series from the '60s, which is relevant for being not only the first Majokko/Magical girl anime, but also the first shoujo anime. It was alright, save for the uncomfortable ""Cowboy vs Indians"" game played by the Hanamura triplets; I probably would have watched more had the whole series been subbed, but unfortunately episodes 8-41, and 49-109 are missing subtitles (this is annoyingly common with children's and older anime). As it's unlikely this series will ever be completely subbed, I decided to cut my losses and dropped it after episode 7.I wanted to add it to my list on Letterboxd, and that's how I found this short film. Naturally, I immediately watched it. Released during the airing of Mahoutsukai Sally 2, the '80s reboot, this film tells a self-contained story about Sally and friends saving spring by visiting the fairy world. It has some cute moments, but nothing really grabbed me. The most noteworthy thing about this is the fact Sumire is voiced by Hisakawa Aya, whom you'll recognise for voicing Sailor Mercury, Keroberos, and Cure Moonlight (I only just found out she also voiced Hassan in Garzey's Wing. I didn't know that before because I've only watched it dubbed... Garzey's Wing is probably the only anime I prefer dubbed).Maybe I'll watch the '80s series someday, and if the subtitle gods grant us their blessings maybe I'll give the original another go, but for now this is where my short walk with Sally ends....Also, that OP lowkey slaps.";Mixed Feelings

Key players are an medium sized, unfurnished office building, electric discharge style visual overlays, and the overlay of a women's head and her hands. The visuals create a mix of unsettling and curious emotions in me.Story: The camera moves trough an unfurnished office building, with a short excursion to the outside, in relative darkness. The movement is smooth, not jumpy with some scene changing cuts. Overlayed are three visual effect. First, the face of a gesturing woman and her hands. The main gesture is to cover her eyes. Second, electric discharge / flash style bright lines and shapes. Third, random light sources of different colors, mainly spots. The camera moves trough this for four minutes and ends on the still of the woman, of which now the full upper body half shown. 3/10Animation: Parts of the short relies on cutting and camera position, not on animation. The light and line effects and the floating face in 1982 probably counted as animation, as CGI as such was not yet widely known and used. On the technical level everything is well executed for it's time, even for 2019 it's not bad. It still is something any video semi-pro can do today, maybe less artistically. 4/10Sound: Mid-tempo ambient electronic music which changes over time, but not much. It supports the visuals pretty well and creates a mood I would describe as a mix of unsettling, warm, and curious. Thought was put into the sound department, so I can give a 5/10.Character: The main ""characters"" are the building, the movement, and the visual overlays. Unlike in other Itou shorts, there is a less clear focus on space and movement. The effects steal the show here. 2/10Enjoyment: It's still an experimental short, do not expect to be entertained. However, the visuals and ambient music creates an almost cozy feeling, so watching is no pain. It isn't thought provoking either. 4/10Overall: (3+4+5+2+4)/5=3.6, rounded to 4.";Not Recommended

BUT BUT BUT, it does grow on you and I was more invested in the characters' reunion and seeing how their relationship would unfold, and I hate how adaptations are mostly preliminaries to promote the manga, because it always leaves us at a cliffhanger, and YES, this one does.

It's cliché but at the same time, if you're bored like me, it's NOT THAT BAD to pass the time with if you're in the mood.

1;Meng Ta: Xue Mi Cheng;Sporcupine;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sporcupine;3;"This show has a very compelling concept: certain individuals that are deemed exceptionally skilled (or otherwise qualified) are recruited into the Dream Tower to help subdue nightmares/dreams/demons(?) that have gotten strong enough to affect the waking world.The main character is a grifter/thief who is chosen by the recruiters as an exceptionally skilled individual, and he's forcibly brought into the tower while trying to escape arrest. There, the story of his interaction with the dream world begins.Unfortunately, this show is AWFUL. It completely flubs the compelling premise by making the main character extremely unlikeable; he's a pathetically whiny teen with some skills for committing petty crimes, and they completely failed to make him a lovable rogue (which is, I assume, what they were going for). He, like almost every other character in the show, constantly switches back and forth between being smart and being SO. VERY. STUPID. and absolutely worthless in any situation.The show's description plays up that he's ""funny"", which is simply untrue; I'm not convinced any of the writers for this show have ever worked on comedy before. He can only be described as ""obnoxious"" and a coward. They spend long, meandering (aka time-filling) sequences where he just causes mischief (because he's a petty criminal and mischief is his defining character trait) or almost dies because he's suddenly literally too stupid to stay alive.This season's entire 13 episodes take place in the space of 2 or 3 days, and almost NOTHING happens other than mischief. They could have fit all of the content into 3 episodes if they cut away the filler and paced it better. The small bit of plot that does manage to come through is barely comprehensible; more than anything, it feels like the writers don't have a destination in mind.Theoretically, these issues may be fixed with more seasons (and a LOT of character development), and then someone could edit this season down to a 20 min prologue.

0;Xin Shen Bang: Yang Jian;helcchi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/helcchi;9;Despite a wildly imaginative modernization, this is surprisingly one of the most faithful portrayals of the character Yang Jian from Investiture of the Gods, a 16th Century Chinese novel. From the character designs to the worldbuilding through meticulously researched historical details, Light Chaser really outdid themselves this time. And with mindblowing visuals that put hollywood to shame, this really is a movie that should be seen on the big screen.It’s technically the sequel to Nezha Reborn, but you don’t have to watch Nezha before Yang Jian, or even at all, as they are not connected (yet). However, as the New Gods cinematic universe expands, both Nezha and Yang Jian's significance will increase, and they are a pretty good introduction into lore of Chinese legends. Investiture also shares canon with Journey to the West and Lotus Lantern, so there may be crossovers.Mythological beasts straight out of the Classic of Mountains and Seas, quotes from ancient Chinese poets and philosophers, archaic calligraphy and cultural relics, real life locations with historical significance and legendary isles in the divine realm, all help tell this story through a distinctly Chinese lens.The animation is cutting edge. Each character’s body language is unique, and subtle muscle movements like when Yang Jian clenched his jaw really gave the character depth of emotion. Attention to the smallest details like the different textures of the fabrics and the intricate patterns woven into them breathed life into the most mundane aspects.The cinematography also produced some of the most stunning scenes in Chinese animation history - Chenxiang walking through the curtains at Duyue Pool and the colossal monuments of the gods at Mount Hua elicit visceral feelings.Props to the animators for finally depicting an accurate Erlang. I was so sick of seeing the countless TV adaptations slapping a stylized sticker on the actors’ foreheads and calling it a “third eye”. That’s bullshit, they look nothing like an eye. I don’t understand why these modern dramas insist on portraying him this way. So it was great to see him back with a realistic third eye.Personally, I don’t have much to fault about the movie, but I can see how the 2+ hour duration can be taxing on some. Yang Jian is a movie that demands attention because it is a story that spans millennia. This is a character steeped in over 3000 years of history, so it would’ve been almost impossible to condense it into a single movie, and they had to add the plot of the Lotus Lantern on top of it. It might be a bit too ambitious for the studio, but that shouldn't be a concern for casual viewers.I would’ve liked to see the story focus on the titular character all the way through instead of Chenxiang, as during the second half of the movie it just felt like Yang Jian had taken a back seat. There is hope for the sequel though, and I’m interested in how the studio would bring the story from the Jin Dynasty to modern day after the timeskip.;Recommended

The characters are well-designed, and the action scenes are executed with attention to detail. My favorite scene is when Yan Jian uses one of his abilities making his feet glow as he is seamlessly glides on water and even scales trees through the jungle as his nephew follows his steps. This made even a simple scene, that most studios would overlook, come to life. I'd give the art a 9 out of 10.The music in the movie is fitting and adds to the overall atmosphere. It succeeds in adding an extra layer of tension and drama to the action scenes. Great overall but not exceeding expectations, I'd give the music an 8 out of 10.Although New God's primary strength lies on it's animation, its characters compliment it well. They all have their own problems and situation to handle. This creates longevity and excitement for more great moments to happen.

The general animations and art style are quite good, though the action/fight scenes could really use some work (they are too stiff). It's quite a decent watch. However, when looking into the plot development and world building aspect, it leaves alot to be desired. There are simply too many plot convenient things that happen, and much of the world building is lacking, especially if you don't understand much D&D (it seems it has many D&D elements though I don't really know much about D&D). His first time traveling to the shadow realm prompted a ""goddess meeting and status window"" and got him a book that somehow informed him of the king's assassination of his brother, like what? Was that really necessary? The plot is also a bit too disjointed, and not much explanation of how the developments went from a to b; there seem to be some measure of time-skip that lead to certain developments that don't quite get discussed. (More in the adaptation comparison section). These problems with the plot progression, plot convenient events, time-skips and lack of world-building, can really confuse those who are new viewers. Despite these problems, this donghua is still a decent watch.Now as an adaptation:There are many problems and changes I find quite disagreeable. If I were to describe the general changes to the plot from the novel, then there would be two main points. First, this donghua adaptation changed the serious, world and kingdom building type novel into a more childish comedy fantasy story (with a touch of romance [like between Heidi and the old knight]). Second, when it comes to the plot, it felt like they took a giant ax to the world-building and plot, then strung together major plot points from the novel and made some things up to fill in the gaps.The first major change was the whole meeting the ""goddess"" in the whole shadow realm and the status/save&load screen. That was really unnecessary. There were no game-like moments in the novel, and from there he obtained a kind of cheat book that allows the MC to find out about some assassination attempt that he used to threaten the king to return his pioneer/colonizing rights. In the novel, the MC skillfully used rumors and politics to manipulate and pressure the kingdom to recognize him and return his right to pioneer.The book that allowed him to simulated/view the past and had the Magic Net formula was originally found in the Shadow Realm, and had a back story of why/how it was created. The novel used this to introduce the concept of the Shadow Realm and display the differences between how the kingdom's nobility viewed magic and what magic could potentially do; essentially, a low ranking magician was desperate to save his daughter and used the power of math/precise calculations to supplement his low talent as opposed to brute force that the traditional magicians view as important.The donghua also cuts out tons of kingdom building and tech advancement. In regard to the kingdom building, they cut almost all the slow reforms the MC used to increase productivity and reform the feudal order, but slowly enough to lead the serfs to our modern concept of ""freedom"" rather than just drop it on them and cause a culture shock. When it comes to tech development, all of the research and development and the trial and error as MC tried to translate Earth's technology to this planet's tech were all left out. Instead, what we got was new tech randomly dropping in with little explanation on how it was created.Now comes the problem with the contrived plot: 700 year old humans (like the old knight) and the evil organization he was connected to. Humans shouldn't live that long, this change really makes the reappearance of the MC less meaningful (at least among humans). They also worked in some ancient feud between the knight and the evil organization instead of having the paths of the two groups accidentally intersect (evil group was worried about MC and monitoring him but did not want to get into conflict yet). This battle between them also ended up pulling in religion/the saint which didn't happen in the novel, these should have been completely separated events.The dream world arc was actually not bad and I don't have much complains about that.Finally, the ""final battle"" and the guns/cannon should not have made their way into the story yet. While I do agree it was cool, the MC was trying to keep a low profile while developing his power, so he would not have invited anyone to watch his battle. This battle should have depleted the MC's salvaged magic armor and weapons and then the guns would have been invented/deployed after this first defensive battle.Overall, the adaptation was not very good; as I had previously said, it felt like they took an ax to the plot and strung together major plot points with some childish ideas to fill in the gaps left behind.Adaptation score (how faithful to source): 4/10";Mixed Feelings
1;Changye Kaita Zhe;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;6;"The Sword of Dawn (although the translation given by a prior reviewer, ""Expansion by the Pioneers"", is more accurate) follows the journey of an anonymous character from a modern world (presumably similar to ours) transmigrated into the dead progenitor of a failing clan, Gaowei, that by some magic was caused to revive when the tomb was disturbed. The new world is a sort of Dungeons & Dragons high fantasy type of setting that almost breaks the 4th wall since Gaowei is familiar with the cliches. Using that knowledge, and unexplained knowledge of modern military command and electrical engineering, it seems, Gaowei pieces together his party consisting of a thief, knight, magician, and druid and experiments with magic networks to simulate modern technology. His task: The clan that the original Gaowei founded is on the verge of extinction about 1000 years later from raids of demons (that are similar to titans from Attack on Titan), so he must find a patch of undeveloped forest and rebuild everything from the ground up. It deals with a little bit of politics: Gaowei must find a way to keep his villagers content and excited for the new missions, and at the same time he must network with the surrounding, better-established city-states. And at the same time, some mysterious groups are set to undermine his progress. Rather than the D&D aspect, the best analogy I can think of from anime is Log Horizon, except without the obvious MMORPG leveling aspects. But although Gaowei's companions are sort of fumbling at times, and they make a few harem jokes here and there, The Sword of Dawn never devotes so much attention to coddling the side characters or exploring pointless love interests. Besides Gaowei, there are also no ""super-characters"". Every conflict requires planning and teamwork to solve. So by these counts, this might actually be better than Log Horizon, although that isn't saying much (I did not like that show).";Mixed Feelings

0;Fire Emblem Heroes Book III Movie：Cohort of the Dead;DoozyKiddo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DoozyKiddo;7;As someone who has played Fire Emblem Heroes for a total of 3 years (from release date to early 2020), I will admit that the story of the game hasn't really captivated me for the most part and definitely wasn't the main reason for me to play. However, I have given the story a chance, making sure to read every line of dialogue up until the end of Book III.This is very short, only being 1 minute and 36 seconds in length. However, I believe that this was the most impactful scene of the entire game up to that point. This was one of the few times where I did feel invested in the story and felt like reading every line of dialogue in the game finally paid off. It's as if it was all building up to this one moment.The art is good, and the soundtrack is pretty epic. If you're even the slightest bit curious about this, I'd recommend just watching it. It takes less than 2 minutes, and it was much better than I expected.;Recommended
0;Fuku-chan no Sensuikan;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;6;Fuku-chan's submarine has surprisingly turned out to be the better one of the various Japanese war propaganda films I've come to watch so far. The amount of detail in every frame is quite a sight to behold. From the backgrounds in nature to the inner walls of the submarine, I never felt the quality of the art direction drop from its stellar heights.As far as pacing goes, the movie is a slow crawl. It's goal is propaganda and it works on that with a hammer instead of a precision tool. Patriotism and fervor are a constant refrain throughout the film, but the plot drags along at a snail's pace leaving me impatient.The sound design was poor here. I'm unsure if this was an artifact of the archival process of a lack of budget during production. Sound effects didn't fit the context of the visuals more often than I would like.I found it eery how similar the movie feels to the German feature Das Boot, also about a submarine's escapades during the World War.;Mixed Feelings
0;Choegang Habche: Mix Master;AhiruArima;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AhiruArima;8;This was a really good anime. It's not something for people above the age of 15 to watch. You will definitely find it very childish. I would recommend it to anyone below the age of 13. It's mostly aimed for a much younger audience. It's definitely not boring. It is such an amazing anime for small kids. I watched it when I was around 12 years old and I loved it! The story was really good. It mostly revolves around Dit who is the main character. Later the story mostly revolves around Moreen. Most of you might know Dit from the 1st season. However the other characters are all new. Most of the people who have seen the first season might miss the older characters but you will definitely love the news ones. For me, the new ones are better. The characters were well designed. The opening theme was awesome (I prefer it without the vocals). I really enjoyed the show. It's a great series to watch if you love battles jut like the ones in Pokemon. And finally I have to say that this is an interesting anime to watch.;Recommended
0;Qing Chi Hong Xiaodou Ba!;iamDragoncat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iamDragoncat;10;First of all, I wanna say I didn't know what I was going into once I decided to watch this. Or rather, I didn't know what to expect from 12 episodes of which each lasts for 3 minutes.I have to say though, I got what I expected and more! I like the story, it's very fun to follow. One of the things I have to absolutely praise is the sound in this ONA. The voice acting is cute as hell for the main character, the choice of some tracks (and some images) is very curious and clearly influenced by popular media and memes. It kinda gave me the thought that the people making this ONA had a lot of fun doing so.Speaking of the animations, I have to say I love them. I don't really know how I would describe them, but the closest adjective I can think of is cute. Now, this might be because of the images themselves, not the animations, however, I stand my ground here.All in all, I have to say this is an absolutely brilliant, short little series that I have enjoyed watching. And you can fit an episode of it anywhere! So I do recommend watching this.;Recommended
0;Katasumi no Uroko;Celine3107;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Celine3107;8;"Katasumi no Uroko is a lovely little story about fond childhood memories and how a special person can make a big impact on a young, curious mind. Although the English title may not be the most catchy and the synopsis can leave one slightly confused, I'd say this short film is worth taking a chance on. Why? I'll try to sum up its highlights without spoiling the plot.First of all, this anime short is beautifully drawn. The images look like soft pencil sketches filled sparingly with watercolour in certain places. The muted colour scheme of mostly beige, grey, peach and teal with spots of turquoise enhances the nostalgic feeling you get from watching the film. The art style certainly makes it seem quite raw and homemade, but still cohesive and well-made as the style compliments the story. The result is nostalgic in a nice, tranquil sort of way.The story of Katasumi no Uroko is simple yet heartwarming. Without spoilers I can say that the themes explored here are childhood, memories, growing up and growing old. Themes that should be relatable to many viewers - but I suspect they are more likely to stir the feelings of slightly older viewers than those of the very young.The score is classical and orchestral, with violins, flutes, piano and the like, and this surprised me. I found it impressive that such a short, simple film was complimented by a charming, complex score that suits it really well. No composers are credited here on MAL and since I cannot read Japanese, I don't know where the soundtrack came from nor who the seiyuus are. What I can say is I really enjoyed their performances - at the very least I've seen plenty of anime with much worse voice acting than what's delivered here. The museum director's seiyuu fits his character perfectly, with a warm and reassuring voice, and the young girl is voiced by an actual child, and I just love it when that's the case. It's a rare occurrence in the world of anime which brings with it a feeling of authenticity.Let's be honest though - Katasumi no Uroko is no masterpiece. At 9 minutes long it can only do so much, but personally I'm glad it didn't attempt to overreach. It's best enjoyed as the simple short film that it is. My only gripes would be with the editing of certain shots that came off as a bit unfortunate and the fact that the pacing is off in the beginning, the camera dwelling on shots to a degree that you're wondering if you've accidentally paused the video. So don't go in expecting too much, especially in the areas of animation and character development.Viewers will probably find that Katasumi no Uroko is different from typical anime as it's not the work of an established studio or creator but the graduation project of its director, Megumi Ishitani, and therefore is more on the ""artsy"" side. I haven't been able to find any information on who created the art and animation, or if all of it is indeed the work of Ishitani herself. Her professor at the department of Animation at Tokyo University of the Arts, the Oscar-nominated short film veteran Koji Yamamura, is credited as the film's producer. Still, Katasumi no Uroko feels like a very personal project, as if it's a story from the director's own life.Megumi Ishitani doesn't have a long list of anime attributed to her on MAL at the moment of writing. Since the making of Katasumi no Uroko she has been praised for her work as an episode director and storyboard creator on Dragon Ball Super, and is currently working for Toei Animation. After watching Katasumi no Uroko, I'll be keeping an eye out for her coming works. (Also, she directed a kids' anime for NHK called ""Butt Detective"" which I believe speaks for itself)All in all, Ishitani's graduation film Katasumi no Uroko is a beautifully imagined short story from a promising young director that would be worth spending a few minutes of your time to watch. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.";Recommended

0;Ghost;Shimbels;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shimbels;5;"""I made this work because I wanted to try out the idea of floating images in midair that had come to me when making THUNDER. The entire work was shot frame-by-frame with long exposures. I filmed this in the company dorm I was living in in the middle of the night after I had come home from work, and thought I might die from what had become my daily pattern of sleeping for two hours in the morning then going off to work."" - Takashi ItoAt one time in my life, when the circumstances of my depression brought together a healthy balance of narcissism and self loathing, I would often make stop motion films and sound collage works in the middle of the night. In the case of the films, I would creep around the corridor that lead from my parent's room to the bathroom, smearing soap on a camera phone lenses and taking pictures of lights with different coloured socks and shit on them.https://i.imgur.com/lyBNINq.png""Wow, what's this piece of absolute complete bullshit?"" Well sure, you're not wrong in thinking that, but this is just a frame from a series of images making up a film, chill. The use of masking was important to the art. The fabric let through little clumps of light that the camera wasn't able to render into a coherent image, and the refractive property of the soap scattered these parcels to further confuse things. Unfortunately I had trouble conveying the feeling of isolation that would have led to these images having any emotional weight, because I don't really know what I'm doing.If I had been smart like Ito, I would have used the space itself to create my montage, given that it is actually possible to parse the intellectual context of the imagery that way. His use of colour and space within the frame is excellent, but even better is that this virtuoso composition is paired with a kind of clumsy tracking that grounds the film in the idea of ""being made by some weirdo"". Vulnerability makes the work accessible and emotionally sharp to the kind of person who knows what it's like to creep around at night making shit that almost no one else in the world will possible ever care about and being immensely proud of it.Unfortunately I do have one small gripe with this, and that's the use of the quivering shadow people. It forces me to look at the work in a light that I think doesn't suit its aesthetic sensibilities. Introducing ""actors"" into a work that I feel is more about the space undermines the idea that I have of the work just a bit.";Mixed Feelings

0;Grim;Shimbels;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shimbels;7;It opens with a hand, covering a lens. Shots in films are constrained by the moment the editor begins and ends the cut, the long shot might seek to produce a dreamlike effect by holding the gaze for longer than one can bear, or the shots can go by quickly and in turn bring these margins into the forefront and make them the subject of the shot. Ito's hand does this in a comical or playful way. Here's a margin, he says. In stop motion every single frame is separated by cuts, the filmmaker chooses to use his trickery to lend the scene a sense of continuity. But here's some black space to chop the shot, Ito says, and he puts his hand in front of the camera.Anyway enough of that heady preaching. This one is interesting because it's in a way humorously sinister, in that it all seems so on the nose. I could see myself hating it for this reason but I suppose I have a soft spot for Ito's impeccable sense of style. It just works, and it's lots of fun.;Recommended

I notice Takashi Ito's films have a tendency to do this.This is a 8 minute long experimental short that uses live-action footage for self expressive purposes. The score that permeates throughout i would have to describe as Dark Ambient-esque. Quite drone oriented with mild Noise. It gives the name further meaning. I don't think i could ever know the right way to interpret this without asking the creator. But if i had to make a guess, it's to showcase the dreariness of routine and everyday life.

0;Naoko no Tropic Angel: Hyouryuu;Xionea;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Xionea;10;"English subs did not exist at the time of writing this, so I made my own to properly experience the story.Notable hentai tags: vanilla, incest, urination.80s hentai is a rare breed, not too many exist as it didn't start to become more common until the 90s. This hentai is rough, the art certainly did not age well, and artifacts of the old VHS era occur. However, it doesn't ruin the experience, in fact I think it adds to the vintage feel. It made me incredibly nostalgic for a time I did not live in.Tropic Angel tells the story of Mina and Shigeru leaving America to head back to Japan. However, disaster strikes (don't be frustrated when you don't get an answer to ""that""), leaving them and a blonde American girl named Jenny stranded on an uninhabited island. This begins the tale of these three souls and their sexual urges overflowing.The art is obviously very dated. It screams ""80s"" and if you're not used to it, it may take a bit to get comfortable with. And for a hentai that, as far as I know, never received a modern re-release, the quality is rather low, but it's not unbearable. Personally, I liked it, but I understand it's not for everyone.Sound is actually surprisingly good! The BGM is pretty good for the H scenes, and even has a vocal cover in there too. Not something you hear too often outside of OP and ED songs.Mina is the main protagonist of the OVA, as the events are told in her narrative. She is arguably the only one who gets any kind of character development (as much as you can get in a 22 minute hentai, anyways). Shigeru and Jenny are the other two protagonists, nothing really special to say about them.Personal enjoyment was a solid 10/10. To live life on an uninhabited island, free of all worries, indulging yourself in the pleasures of sex and living a life of pure happiness, the world the OVA created is one that I can seeing myself fantasizing about.It's a very, very simple and vanilla hentai, I can't stress that enough.

0;Shinshuu Sudama-hen;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;3;"“Shinshuu Sudama-hen” is a 4-episode OVA about a vein of gold ore called the “Golden Dragon,” whose location can only be discovered by “joining” (read: having intercourse) with a particular woman who has inherited the blood of the gods. In the beginning, a man is assassinated, but in his dying breath, he tells Kageshichiro, the hero, that his daughter, Kageshichiro’s childhood friend Orie, holds the key to the Golden Dragon. There are fights with lots of ninjas (especially female ninjas), and breasts are shown (and squeezed) repeatedly. Orie gets kidnapped, but the hero and his friends save her and keep her in hiding, at least for the first part.Without going into spoilers, sex and rape in particular are used as plot devices in this one, so that should tell you how messed up it is. In addition to Orie, some other women have “spirits” called “sudama” in them, and one can receive these spirits’ powers by having sex with the women, willingly or not, which happens quite often.In addition to the frequent raping, there is naturally a lot of blood and violence, as characters murder each other in pursuit of the gold. Hardly any of the characters are given background stories, however, so it’s hard to sympathize when they get killed off. They’re just kind of there one minute and dead the next. And sometimes you think they’re dead, but they show up alive in a later scene. And the ending is as anticlimactic and cliche as they come.As far as technical aspects go, the art and animation are poor. Most of the characters are either downright ugly or unattractive at best. One guy even has a cone-shaped head. There seems to be an obsession here with showing scenes of squeezing breasts, as well as showing people's feet while walking; the latter makes me think they recycled the same basic animation of a person walking and just changed the coloring, etc. to fit each character and scene. There are also too many sounds and scenes of swords unsheathing and clashing, particularly in slow motion, and the frequent flashing gave me a headache. Also, a lot of times, characters speak without their lips moving.Moving on to sound, the voice acting is not good. Also the music feels out of place — there’s often a harpsichord playing in the background, which doesn’t really fit a show about samurai and ninjas. The music is all instrumental and uninspired. And as mentioned earlier, sound effects for swords clashing and getting unsheathed are used far too often.Overall, the characters aren't sympathetic or interesting. Plus, the story is hard to follow, and uses sex/rape as a plot device. This OVA feels like a cross between Maryuu Senki and Crying Freeman, and that's not a good thing. Avoid at all costs.";Not Recommended
0;Lemon Angel YJ-ban;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"“Lemon Angel: YJ-ban” is a 2-episode OVA based on the manga “Lemon Angel,” and both are part of the mixed media project of the same name, which also includes a few anime series unrelated to this. While all of these stem from “Cream Lemon,” which is an adult title, none of them are X-rated, but they do contain a fair amount of ecchi scenes. “YJ-ban” should probably be tagged as an ecchi title, like its manga counterpart.Anyway, these two episodes with self-contained stories present the reckless youth-infused shenanigans of high schooler Medaka, her friends Rie and Satomi, and her boyfriend, Keisuke. The first episode revolves around the gang preparing for their school’s festival, with Keisuke playing in a rock band and Rie filming a “documentary” as everyone prepares for it. Naturally, things don’t go as planned, partially due to interpersonal conflict, and partially because of a typhoon.Despite the second episode being called “Medaka’s Time Capsule,” no mention of a time capsule is made until there’s about 3 minutes left in the episode, after which the time capsule subplot is quickly shoved in with a nonsensical fanservice joke. This episode is largely about Medaka, her sister, Keisuke, and some cafe owner guy they’re acquainted with going on a road trip to pick up Rie from a rest stop in the middle of nowhere, because she had second thoughts while trying to hitchhike to her crush’s place in Hokkaido. This is interspersed with semi-philosophical talk about how they’re all doing different things during their summer vacation and may go their separate ways in the future, and how having free time is a luxury. Meanwhile, Rie has to fend off a creepy guy who’s trying to get too friendly with her as she waits for them. They later all go pick up Satomi, who’s been studying for university exams in cram school, and continue their road trip, after which they decide to make a time capsule to commemorate it.The plots of both episodes are by and large easy to follow, but there are some odd narrative decisions that either don’t make sense or go nowhere, like the “haunted piano” scene in the first episode, and the whole time capsule thing in the second one.The characters are okay for what they are; there’s no development, of course, but once we’re introduced to them, we pretty much understand their personalities and motivations right away. Satomi’s character is under-utilized however, as she doesn’t get nearly as much screen time as Medaka, Keisuke or Rie.I felt that the dialogue was too simple and could have been better. There are a couple of memorable lines, however — “A typhoon can’t stop rock and roll” in the first episode, and “I hope your [private parts] get crushed under a trucks' tires!” in the second.As far as technical aspects go, you can tell this didn’t have much of a budget, but they did okay with what they had. The animation is not bad, and there is even some sakuga in some parts, although there are issues with lip flaps not matching voices sometimes. I like the character designs. The voice acting is average. The music in the first episode is all from a rock band called Rogue, and there’s an insert song where they make it look like Keisuke is singing it, but the singer’s voice is so different from Keisuke’s that it doesn’t work very well. The second episode’s soundtrack is instrumental only. The background music in general is okay, but sometimes it doesn’t match the scenes it’s used in (like a dramatic scene having cheery music). The direction isn’t that good; there are some long, lingering shots on objects and scenery that just aren’t important, for example, and it almost feels like they were doing that to add to the running time.The main issue with “YJ-ban” (or draw, depending how you look at it) is the explicit content. Both episodes feature an attempted sex scene between Keisuke and Medaka that gets comically (?) interrupted. In addition to that, there are multiple scenes with partial nudity, and a scene with an attempted rape that gets downplayed and dealt with in an uncomfortably lighthearted way.Overall, if you go into viewing “Lemon Angel: YJ-ban” with low expectations and the understanding that it’s an old ecchi title, it’s borderline watchable, despite the low budget, explicit content and sometimes nonsensical narrative choices. As far as I know, there’s currently no English version available for this, but the dialogue is simple enough that you can probably get the gist of what’s going on even without understanding much Japanese. Only recommended for those who know what they’re getting into and are not expecting a masterpiece.";Mixed Feelings
0;Da Li Si Rizhi 2nd Season;blueoe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/blueoe;10;MASTERPIECEWhat is best about animations is they can bring you stories which is very unlikely could be adapted into live-action because of enourmous budget it needs. And White Cat Legend using this advantage of animation greatly. Sadly it is not getting the attention it deserves. I saw many different series, but i have never saw any anime that underrated as much as White Cat Legend is. People skip this 'cause of it is chinese and their first impresion of art style is 'cartoon-ish'. Don't do this.Story basicly is court drama in Tang Dynasty, very well balanced with action, comedy, mystery and some politics. Main story was hard to follow in season 1, but it is much better now. All characters are interesting and have equal roles in story. Just few characters have some supernatural power, other than that story is realistic. Production is in movie quality. Compared to others it could be say that none any other manga/manhwa/manhua adaptation got better treatment this one has. Studio kept the story same, but they changed every scene to better and added many more new scenes. Animation is so fluid, choregraphy is best, musics are beautiful, voice acting is top notch. What could i ask more for..? Highly recommended!!;Recommended
1;Da Li Si Rizhi 2nd Season;athenadon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/athenadon;8;"The second season of Da Li Si Rizhi (White Cat Legend) continues right after the events of the first season and takes a darker turn, with a greater focus on political intrigue and Li Bing's past. Li Bing & co investigate General Qiu Shenji's involvement in the burning of Bo Zhou city, but things aren't as simple as they seem. Not to worry though, there is still the same slice of life and comedy from season one interspersed between heavier moments.The supporting characters really shine here; we get to see more of their past, their motivations, and their connection to the main characters. The animators and voice actors did an excellent job bringing the characters to life by displaying the complex emotions and personalities of each one. There are plenty of terrible characters, but no terribly-written characters. It's all too easy to get attached to them.Story is good, and it works largely because of how well-written the characters are. Same as in season one, the characters are the ones that drive this story. Everything that happens is the cause and effect of each characters' decisions, like a butterfly effect.""What would have happened if I did things differently?"" ""This wasn't what I intended, where did things go so wrong?"" ""Is this my fault?""The characters repeatedly struggle with these questions, and it's interesting to see the results of everyone's actions influencing each other and shaping the finale.Art quality is good if not better than first season, music/sound is excellent (OP is by Zhou Shen, the same person who sang Big Fish & Begonia's theme song) and enhances the atmosphere. One instance of good animation+sound was during a graphic part of the story where they used non-graphic visuals and sounds to cue the audience on what was happening, and made the scene just as impactful as if the audience were witnessing it themselves. (Graphic scenes were not allowed in the show so they had to be creative when illustrating certain scenes.)Only critique (this is more a personal preference) is the show's pacing: This only happened a few times but it was awkward when they'd abruptly switch to comedy right after a heavy scene. The director likely wanted to give the audience a breather, since many people who haven't read the manhua weren't prepared for the serious turn this season.Where to watch: the entire show is free on Youtube!";Recommended
0;Sayokyoku;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;6;"A fascinating early short from Yamamura, as this is far removed from his usual style, not being drawn or painted. It's kind of a mixed-media/collage style that appears to use clay, paper, and other objects for animation. The art direction is great, and it appears some of the backdrops are possibly fuzzy color photographs, when it's not always readily apparent as to whether or not these are painted backdrops or constructed models and facades. There's a lot of depth with the addition of foreground and background objects, with the figures usually occupying the middle. The fascinating thing about shorts like this is that handcrafted aesthetic that leaves you wondering how a lot of it was made, and there is nothing else that looks entirely like it, though there are a number of experimental and surreal short films of a similar nature and general aesthetic.It's difficult to get much of anything from the story, as it's largely visual in its storytelling and somewhat cryptic. There are a few inter-titles that set the scene with a rare burst of semi-coherence, in contradiction of the cave-man utterances of the puppets, which sound like Yoko Ono screeching over a Yoji Kuri animation. The reference of a character named ""K"" brings to mind Kafka, unsurprisingly, as Yamamura would adapt that author's Country Doctor story in later years.The short is pretty much surrealist nonsense, absurdist, and a mood piece, and I doubt many people would derive much significance out of it, and it's also very short. Despite coming across as a tad eerie, it's even rather comical, with it's cutesy skeleton and the ridiculousness of the ending. It's for semi-completionists and admirers of Yamamura. Definitely not a good entry point for the director's work, but it's perfectly watchable and interesting for such a short run and has a nice aesthetic.";Mixed Feelings

Doll Knights no Kiseki;still-not-sharp;https://myanimelist.net/profile/still-not-sharp;6;"I'm fairly sure that the only reason for why this OVA exists is to showcase two villains who never appeared in the show; Dana, and her minion, Giize. Presumably, it was originally intended for them to appear in the main show, but the writer couldn't decide how they could be tied into the story. I don't think that this OVA is in the same canon as the show, as there is nothing in the show that suggests this.The new villains are the only thing that really makes this OVA unique when compared to the show, as everything else is the same. The main characters act in exactly the same way here as how they act in the show, the music is still mediocre, and the art is no different from how it is in the show, either. Given this, I see no reason to repeat what I have already said in my review of the show.The designs of the new villains are pretty unique in comparison to the other characters, so there is that going for them, but that's it when it comes to the positives. Thirty minutes isn't nearly enough time to develop characters so that they aren't one-dimensional, so that's what the villains are; evil, and nothing else. I suppose this isn't a fair critique, but what more can I say?Ultimately, even though this OVA probably isn't canon to the show, there's no point in watching it unless you watched and liked the show. I'm sure that those in the target audience will find some joy in seeing more of Licca and her friends.";Mixed Feelings

0;Oishinbo: Nichibei Kome Sensou;PowerUpOrDie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PowerUpOrDie;5;"A fascinatingly dated piece of animation that will be very interesting to a small niche of people and probably bore the rest to tears.'Oishinbo: The Japan-America Rice War' is very much a product of its time, and that time is the early 90's, when economic tensions between Japan and the United States were at an all-time high. Giving a full historical background explanation would probably require starting at the end of the Second World War and then navigating 50 years of Post War economic policy and Cold War diplomacy. Suffice to say, by the early 90's Japan was booming, the US was treading water, and a lot of name-calling was going on in both directions.The Oishinbo manga was never afraid to state its opinions on political issues that affected food, and this anime movie adaptation is no different. However, while it would have been easy to churn out a bland ""Banzai Nippon"" propaganda piece, the anime actually takes a fairly balanced approach. Both the US and Japan are called out for various real or perceived faults and hypocrisies, and in the end both sides (optimistically) agree to try to do better.However, the story isn't tightly focused. It bounces around a number of issues affecting Japanese rice agriculture, with American rice imports being only one of them. By the end of movie the main topic of discussion has meandered over to the use of pesticides in farming and everything gets wrapped up ""because we say so"". This movie touches on a lot of topics that will interesting to a certain niche audience, but doesn't weave them together terribly well.Art and Sound are both noticeably aged. There's ""cool old"" animation, and then there's ""old old"" animation- this is the latter. Sound is pretty bland, it's mostly just people talking for long stretches of time. The characters are static as well and having some foreknowledge of them from reading the manga will be necessary.As a historical artifact, ""Oishinbo: The Japan-America Rice War"" is a fascinating piece of animation. However, it's also the kind of anime where you have to know what you're getting into before to have any real enjoyment of it. This one is a hard 'skip' for casual viewers.";Mixed Feelings

So, it is no wonder they are unrealistic or messed up in comparison to reality. I find that information to be common knowledge and thus requires no visual explanation or anime to express the point.In terms of the art is unfortunately a tad to fast in sequencing. Perhaps, it is a statement to how when one dreams they can only recall bits and pieces. Although, while that statement has merit it is hard really to fully grade the art if one doesn't want to or lacks the time or patience to revisit the piece.On a positive note i was impressed with added use of real shots embedded into the art. While live shots aren't anime in definition mainly because they are not drawn shows how the brain can transform a simple object with a simple meaning to another object entirely. Not only that but i couldn't help but feel as if the imagination world was a separate world of its own studding us in the real world and trying to mimic are actions. Sure, it is an easily dismissed theory but an interesting thought.Final notation/overall message is don't expect a tell expect a show.;Not Recommended
0;Suzume no Oyado;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;8;The Sparrow's Lodge is an interesting detour in the history of the evolution of the Japanese animated artform. It is authentically Japanese in style and substance. The art is very reminiscent of traditional minimalistic painting style forms of a classical background and the story is an old Japanese folk tale about greed involving interactions between humans and anthropomorphic animals in the vein of Aesop's fables.The art director's choice to make the sparrows be tiny humans dressed in sparrow costume seems to be borrowed from the Noh and Kyogen theatrical styles and inspired by how such a folk tale would be enacted out on a stage play. I found that choice to be a very interesting one that added layers to a short that would otherwise be a pretty run of the mill adaptation of the folk tale.The story ends with all the events of the story actually being a nightmare and allowing for the redemption of the grandmother. I wonder how much of that was the artist's own choice and how much was the constraints of the certification authority considering that the short was primarily directed at kids. Either way, the decision allows for a surreal veneer to hang over the entire story.;Recommended

Such as, is my desire worth the bother? Or, should i steal? With many different ideas on plot's intentions demonstrates that there was not clear enough guidance on direction.ArtModerately drawn. This is a clear example of multiple sketches in animation form. Aside from the animation being somewhat slow paced the artwork is not fully drawn in. A scribbled section here and a scribbled section there. If that was not bad enough you had some random things drawn in. A dead rabbit? A rabbit character?

0;Hustle!! Tokitama-kun;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;5;"This short, created in 1998 by Koji Morimoto has a lot of spirit put into it. However, I feel it also comes up short in many ways, and probably ends up being the director's weakest work. Let me explain why.First, the story is nonsensical. Things happen for seemingly no reason and nothing is motivated by anything. There really isn't much of a tale to be told here at all. Things just happen, nothing has any real meaning to it at all, and then things just kind of end. I will say that for as much of a lack of story there is, things are presented very well.Now, onto the audiovisual side of things, I actually really enjoyed this aspect of it. Considering this was animated in 1998, the CG looks remarkably good, and it looks like there's also a bunch of hand-painted backgrounds included here as well. The whole production is really ambitious, and while the visuals don't completely hold up today, they are still passable, and end up being really interesting when put in the context of being as old as they are.The sound design is pretty well done, with appropriate music throughout and good sound effects and voice acting. The voice actors did a good job of portraying their characters, for sure.Of course, the characters, while they have interesting visual designs, don't really have enough time to get fully fleshed out in the short, 3-minute runtime. The ""mamapapa"" robot is a weird, crazy, hyper-reactive machine... and it's one real trait is simply yelling and going crazy. The kid is your typical rebellious brat character, but his motivations also aren't made clear, and he ends up just feeling kind of empty. The characters aren't necessarily bad; they made a good first impression on me. I just feel like if a bit more time was spent on developing their personalities, I might like them more. Alas, this short is only 3 minutes, so that kind of thing is basically not possible.Overall, I enjoyed this short, somewhat. It was weird, confusing and just kind of ended without telling much of a story. However, the directing was very nicely done, it has a nice audio mix, which sets the tone very well... and the art, while not incredible, was still interesting enough to propel it forward. This short is definitely all style and no substance, but it's a pretty interesting style, and what it provides was interesting enough for the 3 minute runtime.";Mixed Feelings
0;Kentauros no Densetsu;Inter_anime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Inter_anime;5;"There hasn't been a review yet of this anime, so I'll give it a shot. ""Kentauros no Densetsu"" is a somewhat obscure 80s OVA about bikers and motorcycle racing. While it does have some decent moments and ideas, it also has a lot of flaws weighing it down.Starting off with the animation, it's mostly a mixed bag. For the 80s some of the scenes are very well done, especially some of the racing scenes which have the camera floating around giving the illusion of 3D space even though the art is always 2D. The background art is a little bland by today's standards, the notable issue were some of the character's faces and body proportions, especially for the characters of Lady and Arthur, to the point it was a bit uncanny. The music is also fine I guess, there's this cheesy song they keep playing called ""Venus! Jesus!"" that is okay the first time but after the fourth or fifth time in the film it gets downright annoying.The main issue in Kentauros is the ""protagonist"" Ken Shinozaki. I put protagonist in quotation marks because despite being the main character Ken has literally no redemptive features or development across the runtime. His only motivations are that he is infatuated with Lady and he hates losing in motorcycle races. He is extremely rude, even to characters that do nothing but help him like motorcycle mechanic and the fast-food waitress Akane. The character Lady is also frustrating, she shows no real purpose other than fanservice and the film takes every opportunity to show her naked (including the opening scene). Multiple times in Kentauros she makes clear that she has no romantic interest in any of the guys, despite the fact that Ken never gets the message. He even tries to assault her on an occasion, and for no reason towards the end of the film they have sex, even though Lady makes clear she still has no feelings for him.Ironically the best character is the one who is initially played up to be the antagonist. Arthur, despite being Ken's rival for Lady (she doesn't care for him either) actually manages to add something to the scenes he's in, has a somewhat compelling backstory, and whose motivations make sense. Whether intentional or not, I found myself rooting for Arthur in the final race rather than Ken.Overall ""Kentaouros no Densetsu"" is a decent 80s anime which is neither overly bad or good. Personally I thought it was a bit mediocre with the frustrating caste weighing it down, but I've also seen a lot worse, and if you're into retro or racing then this might be the anime for you.";Mixed Feelings
0;Princess Knight☆Catue DVD-BOX Special;theburnmaster;https://myanimelist.net/profile/theburnmaster;10;Really great fanservice from the wonderful animators of this excellent hentai series. The writers outdid themselves by wrapping up a lot of burning questions in regards to the lore of Princess Knight Catue. Despite being a very short and brief animation it manages to contain a lot of important story points and answers. So I will refrain from spoiling anyone on the story. Catue and Nina make a return as do Jin. Sadly Anna is nowhere to be found. Hopefully they make another follow up to find out what happened to her. Apart from that we learn quiet a lot and I appreciated the extra attention to detail featured in this special. It was also just a breath of fresh air because it really felt like the animators were cutting loose and having fun with this one and it really shows. If you are a fan of the original OVA I would highly recommend taking the small chunk of time out to view this masterpiece as well.;Recommended

Some families live as a single unit separately in separate homes. Others live close to each other put in separate rooms like a hotel. Other families are not as blessed and are forced to really pack in and share a room. This story is based on the last two outcomes to really show their message of teamwork. Which is basically each person has their own strength and are raised differently because of cultural or other reasons. When they band as one unit they can defeat many taunting odds. The only part of the story i did not like is when it came to the message and reasoning (the conclusion) they summed it up in one word. Not a very good ending for how short it was.ArtAside from it being black and white the resolution suffered. The only problem is one can't exactly tell how much.

0;Hana no Hi;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;7;"Kind of an absurd take on the drudgery of being a salaryman told in a non-narrative, experimental short format—there's no dialogue at all, and the visual storytelling is not clearcut. The plain characters shuffle from chair to chair in very repetitive scenes, making their way to the nose inspector, who appears to be a manager, assessing the endowment (I guess having a big nose means big success!) by squeezing each nose on each slouched-over worker in a tedious, cyclical process.The direction is pretty effective: even though this is very repetitive, the tight closeups are packed with humorous expressions, sound effects, and motions. The scenes are open enough to interpretation and sans handholding that it's not always immediately obvious what one is to take away from the imagery. At the same time, it's just structured and thematically obvious enough that we can pretty much remain on the same page, just deviating on a few small details.The art is crude but kind of charming, and the sound is minimalistic but effective and never squandered. Not only are some of the details humorous, but the whole thing is sprinkled with visual humor, and I'm not sure if most will appreciate the absurdity of the whole thing, which is the main source of humor. It also helps if one can appreciate a more mundane style of conceptual and visual surrealism, and not just the whacked-out Salvador Dali or Max Ernst school of surrealism.Okay, I guess I'll take the boring interpreter role now:There seems to be a work-related meaning to the nose-squeezing, whereas the nose-rubbing action, which is often accompanied by head rubbing, is more comfort based—or can even be seen as brown-nosing, perhaps. An old man is shown rubbing the head of a young version of the main character, signaling either affection or approval. The main rubs his nose on the fleece of sheep, and there's obviously some symbolism pertaining to a sheep being a herd animal.In the most surreal sequence, the main character rolls down a long line of identical-looking supine elderly men, having his head rubbed and rubbing his nose into their chest. It's kind of creepy and weird, but it does give the vibe of climbing a corporate ladder (though he's rolling down a hill). These actions could be seen as reciprocal behaviors that are part of work. The main does what is needed of him and brown-noses, and he is patted on the head for being a good boy.Most of the salarymen lose their hair, and they become just like this long string of elderly men who are in more senior positions. There's the passing of the torch by the nose inspector to the main character in a hilarious and unexpected sequence and switcheroo.There's some other weird stuff involving what looks like an occult ritual with animals—I think a chicken and a goat—and naked humans revolving in a circle around a sculpted nose (it's kind of oddly shaped, but I guess that must be what it is). A western perspective will probably lean towards Satanism or something, but Japan is not a highly Christian country, and I think there are probably more apt connotations similar to what you would find with the sheep—a comparison and conflation with the salarymen being no different than barn animals that live to do the bidding of the herdsman.Oh, and what artistic short would be complete without a scene unsubtly suggestive of the womb? Of course, I don't believe it has to do with rebirth, but rather a retreat, then being thrust back into the daily grind.Well, your guess is as good as mine. Like a poem, most will interpret certain lines differently if the meaning isn't absolutely explicit. I can definitely see why the rating for most of Wada's shorts is not very high. These are obtuse and have simplistic art. They can be a bit boring if you're solely looking for narrative storytelling and don't appreciate visual poetry—that may sound ""pretentious,"" but I simply mean that it's abstract and interpretive like poetry often is, and it is purely visual, without dialogue. Of course, even for those who can appreciate such a style, they might be underwhelmed by the quaintness of the whole affair.";Recommended

1;Hakubutsushi;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;5;It's a simple student animation from Yamamura. The designs and animation are more than adequate, but it's mostly paint-based morphing animation of various critters into other critters and shapes on a blank-white backdrop. It's not a short in the traditional sense that he usually works with. More so like a demo of his animation chops. Given the title Natural History and some of the imagery, it looks like it charts a course through mythology, ecology, and cosmology in very crude ways. I winced a little bit at the Vitruvian Man overlay, which feels kind of sophomoric, introducing a very concrete idea within this free-flowing framework. The Willem Breuker score is kind of irritating, and I feel there would have been a better fit to synchronize with the imagery, but it works well enough.;Mixed Feelings

0;Anisava;84DaysWithout;https://myanimelist.net/profile/84DaysWithout;7;I stumbled upon Anisava in search of an english dub boring enough to serve as background noise while I practice not sucking in Tekken 7. I still suck at Tekken and I choose to blame my Iron First Tournament ineptitude on an anime too funny to properly focus on anything else.Anisava has your typical office comedy format of dysfunctional relationships and a collection of bizarre personalities who appear to do anything but their actual jobs, but what sets it apart is that the characters are all animals and embody their animalistic tendencies. For instance, Fred the Rabbit is a sex addict who has god knows how many children and cares for none of them. Andy the Kangaroo is a momma's boy to an extent that is disturbing to his fellow co-workers. In moments of frustration, the animals enter a fit of rage where they revert to their beast tendencies and destroy everything around them. This is great.Anisava has a short run time of five minutes per episode that works well in it's favor -no punchline becomes stale or overdone to the point of boredom. The designs may give the uninformed viewer the impression that this is intended for a younger audience. That could not be further from the truth. There is a lot of adult humor about sex, ranging from being good in bed to adultery.The english voice acting is outstanding in the sense of giving the characters voices that properly fit their personalities. Jake the Bear is really fucking stupid, but means well, so he sounds stupid with a caring tone. He isn't voiced in the obnoxious way that feels like the actor is trying too hard to fit a role. I would presume this is the easiest type of anime to do voice acting for, since it revolves around every day humor that anyone working person can understand and the mood is constantly relaxed.It would seem ridiculous to say an anime with just north of 100 scores was the funniest of it's respective season, but that would be the case for me. The aesthetic may not scream quality to a prospective viewer, but the writing and comedic execution warrants a look from anyone interested in office humor with a unique spin.;Recommended

There isn't much depth to them but there isn't really much story either, as some of the jokes did get a chuckle from me, but what is negative about this series is the animation and voice acting.The animation looks cheap as even some of the scenes in it feel lazy and boring like the animators gave up in of giving this series more distinct backgrounds, this series feels more like a cheap cartoon rather than an anime throughout it. Character movements are sometimes stiff and it feels like frames were cut from their scenes to save cost for when they have their freak out moments, when they tear their clothes off and destroy stuff around them. Thankfully nothing explecit is shown, its just becomes a tired gag after the first few times it happens. I can at least give some of the voice actors a pass, as some performences ranged from passable to ear grating, though I did listen to the english dubbed of this series as it was the version I found available, so I can't properly say if the japanese cast did a better or worst job.My final thoughts are this, this isn't a great anime nor is it a bad anime, I find to be just average. It was just short enough that each episode If you like adult comedy and if your at least bit curious of what the show The Office would be like just with animals then give this anime a chance.;Mixed Feelings
0;Naked Wolves;GamerchiX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GamerchiX;7;Naked Wolves is a series that is highly dependent on an open mind to enjoy to the fullest. Using simple flash animation and a unique, yet simple story, it won't be for everyone, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth watching.The story revolves around Arashi, a sumo wrestler who is traveling around the world gaining skills through the people he meets to obtain his ultimate goal, to be the grand sumo champion. In every episode Arashi is a new country/area of the world. The series starts off shaky in the United States, but soon becomes more stable as Arashi continues to travel.The people Arashi meets are a very colorful bunch whom he learns many skills from, such as sumo wrestling moves and morals. Some of the characters are just portrayed downright silly, particularly the black people. They're designed in the stereotypical fashion, you know, giant afros and lips. This kind of blatant stereotype doesn't carry over into all races of the characters, which is a good thing. Because in all honestly, it is a little awkward watching some of the first episodes that take place in the US.The animation is very simple flash animation, most of which are solid colors and thick lines. Personally, I feel that it still looks nice and fits in well with the quirky story. But I'm sure it will very easily turn most people off of the series.As far as sound goes, the voice acting is done well for Arashi and the music is enjoyable. The voice acting for other characters of the series varies, as some of it is purposely done bad to be funny. It's obvious when they do this with the characters so it doesn't really detract from the overall appeal of the voice acting.Despite the fact that the story is obvious, it IS intended for a younger audience. This doesn't mean that an older audience can't enjoy it though. Overall I really enjoyed this series and urge other people to give it a try. The entire series is only going to take up under 5 hours of your life. And just trying it will only waste 5 minutes of your time. The series is actually easy to find as well, so there's no reason not to give it a whirl.;Recommended
0;Boku no Boukuugou;ArrowLance311;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ArrowLance311;7;Well, where do I start? All war anime have a cliché where someone precious to the protagonist dies and Boku no Bokuugou is no exception to this cliché, but rather than dealing and coming to terms with their loss or as the usual story plays out, Boku no Bokuugou follows a plot where our young Yuu does what any fragile child would do. Deny reality, My bomb shelter or it's alternate title is, personally, somewhat of a symbolic title, which I will leave to you since our opinions may differ. The boy after losing his father turns to the one connection that he felt the strongest- the time they spent together making the shelter.What I like about this anime is the simplicity and realistic approach, instead of moping around and being egdelord Kirito here, Yuu simply refuses to believe his life's misfortune and carries on as normally, gladly and blissfully as he could, believing a story of his own making and accepting it as reality. I found this relatable, as surely all of us had this happening to us at one point of time in our lives. The last line in the movie stuck out to me since I thought he still believed his fabricated reality, but thinking about it now, he probably just wanted to believe in that lie, since it is so much easier to do that than to live this hurtful truth called life, for me, I felt his sadness and the resilience to fight that, knowing all to well it is all in vain, hoping- one day, maybe....;Recommended
0;Tondemo Nezumi Daikatsuyaku;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;4;The short review is: If you are five years old, you probably will enjoy this.It's the story of Manxmouse, brought to life by a clay sculptor, who heads out on his own to explore the world. Manxmouse has no fear, until he learns of his fate, which is that he will be eaten by the equally legendary manx cat.Generally light-hearted adventures as Manxmouse comes across non-scary ghosts, a non-scary circus tiger, and a non-scary hawk, among others. Even though he is a mouse, he has long ears and very large rear legs so that he looks like a rabbit, and they take every possible opportunity to remind the view of this.Very simple kid-friendly artwork and animation and simple storyline with simple words - basically it's aimed directly at the toddler set.

0;Oyoge ya Oyoge;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;4;"While other Ikuo Oishi works have drawn direct inspiration from the Disney movies from the time, ""Swim! Monkey, Swim!"" draws more inspiration from the live action films of Hollywood transitioning to the 40s. Talkies were beginning to gain traction, but the stalwarts like Charlie Chaplin were steadfast in their belief that silent films were here to stay and that talkies were a fashionable, but temporary trend in the cinematic experience. At that time, the debate against talkies did have some credible points when it came to on sight filming, with audio recording equipment having a low capture range and being extremely bulky and ill fit to use. Much of the artistic experimentation was taking place within the silent movie scene and the intrusion of the giant audio recording boxes limited much of what dynamic camera movements and occupied camera space in the shot reducing the utility of wide angled lenses.The end of the 30s were a tumultuous time in the cinematic medium, a time of transition. Thus you could see a lot of talking, but also artifacts of the silent film era like interspersed text slides explaining the logistics of scenes just passed or scenes yet to come. Filmmakers were still getting used to the dramatic technological changes the medium was going through and struggling to find a voice that fit the medium. While animation eschewed a lot of these problems since the visual aspect was completely descriptive and drawn by hand instead of enacted, it made itself amenable to a quick transition to the sound filled medium.However, this particular short film struggles to find a definitive voice like many other works of the time period. Artifacts of the silent film era are peppered all over the piece, giving it the aesthetics of a silent film, yet the constant vocalization and exposition of what's on screen seems at odds with the visual elements and borders on grating. The voice acting isn't particularly great and it struggles even more with the quantity of the dialogues peppered in.Swim! Monkey, Swim! very much feels unfinished or perhaps constrained by budgets. The backgrounds are empty in almost every frame and the entire work feels like a rough draft. The animation skips a lot of frames, and feels inferior to Photo Chemical Laboratory, Animation Division's own works from several years past. The story is lackluster and there isn't much exploration in terms of animator techniques. The animated short is an anachronism that doesn't age well beyond the time period, but a good watch for those interested in the historical and contextual aspects of Japanese animated art.";Not Recommended

Or you might a watermelon. Where the story may be hard to grasp at first but the further along you get you might really enjoy the story. Also, midway through you will find seeds that can be used to branch off the story in different directions. Sadly, being a watermelon fan i did not like this blueberry movie. A blueberry film is one that is small in portion and has a sweet taste. If you ever had a blueberry you would know it does not take much to break through the outer layer. While this film of a child having fun that is all the audience sees. There is nothing more to look forward to. In other words quite bland with much layers.ArtI did appreciate the fact the art was different from what i had seen in the past. Hard to put to words but i will try. You have your background nice and strong. Basically untouched by the poisons of being human. You know whether it is over eating or loading our body with unnatural chemicals. Then you have your characters. Which are light and touched. Showing a nice mixture of opposites without one being stronger than the other.Overall: A nice film to relax to. Even if it is just to remember the innocent days of lost youth. A good age friendly film.;Mixed Feelings

At first when I saw it on YouTube, I thought it was gonna be one of those obscure kiddy East Asian shows where I can just make fun of the characters and the plot. But once I found more, I actually became intrigued in it thinking it could actually be ok. I literally downloaded Crunchyroll to watch more, and I was hooked! I watched it on Tubi for the English dub, and went out of my way and started a free trial on NordVPN to watch the Korean Dub on the KBS app.I like the serial format used for this show, because to me it shows how much care was put into the story! I love such detail of the settings and the diversity of the characters. No spoiling, but the plot gets more complex and deeper as you keep watching! And it worked beautifully!The characters may seem generic since you have the energetic Mick, brainy Doc, hungry Marble, strong female character Ellen, and elderly Master Yang, but they're still enjoyable to watch when put together. Mick is my favorite. he's voiced by Cristina Vee and sounds very familiar to Marinette, but more mixed feminine and masculine. He's goal-driven, hilarious, and cute! I also like Ellen cause while being a strong female character, she has a few cute moments. She may not have a versatile personality, but she's got nice depth in her character!Marble may come off as a generic eater of the group, but I enjoy how he was written! I kinda like his relationship with Doc. Mick and Master Yang's running gag with each other with Mick constantly calling Yang ""old man"" is a nice side humor asset to include.The show is a criminally underrated gem that I often promote the show to my friends and family saying they should give it a watch too!

In short it isn't really. The only aspect that remain the same is the general environment. Characters you saw and part one don't show here. Comical portray used in part one does not show here as much. Introduction was okay. Rather than going for an overview of the game playing characters they decided to go at it via a zoom in. In other words the story was at the center or the original shot. You just need to do some fine tuning to get there. The positive approach to this shows how wide spread the field they have to work with. The negative approach is slight mild confusion to the viewer. As for the ending it made sense. Could it have been prolonged? Perhaps but it ended nicely the way it did.Art-art is colorful-On a positive note the artist(s) decided to stick with an art style. Rather than constantly change it up like they did in part one. Maybe it was because of the plots message difference that caused the change. While part one was action based, this part was more emotional based. Which works because the reason to watch this no longer has to be eye catching. If you were a fan of the first one, which most likely did well seeing how this is part two, then there would be no need to strive for your attention and just focuses on the plot.SoundInstrumental again with the right use of instruments.EnjoymentOne might see this as low cut or a chick flick having seen part one. However, you have to understand that is why they did not start out with showing the evil figure's face. For the story was not about the lumberjack but about the dwellers that live in the environment.

0;Oishinbo: Kyuukyoku tai Shikou, Chouju Ryouri Taiketsu!!;Stormy_77;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stormy_77;7;"The Oishinbo series might be the best cooking anime ever produced by Japan despite how ""old"" it is, the reasons for which I will go over below. This almost ""ancient history"" 1990s hidden gem was not much watched despite how good it is, and the series is only partially subbed which is a shame since it is practically the epitome of what a food anime should be. Due to frustrations at not being able to watch the full series, I turned to the movies and was surprised there was no review, so here is the first!Art 3/10Don't kill me but it's the truth. The movie animation is about the same quality as the series except with slightly more ""rounded"" faces to the characters. Animation wise this is considered average in the 1990s. By current 2020+ standards, it's just poor and there's no getting around that.Sound 7/10The OP, Insert, ED and other songs are extremely low key mellow and very suited for the anime. They do however, sound old fashioned, or I would have scored this higher.Story, Character, Enjoyment 9/10Despite the dated art and sound, this is a great movie to watch. It starts with Rival newspapers challenging each other to a Shoukugeki (Food War) with the theme being foods that improve longevity. Our main character, Yamaoka is immediately incentivized when he finds out his hated father is playing for the other side. Yuuko suggests visiting Okinawa as that region has people with the longest life expectancy in the world. Along the way we come across various food philosophies and a plotline on the environment versus profit as a group wants to build an airport that may destroy the Island's ""Emerald Sea"" and Reefs.Everything here was presented well, without any judgment or being preachy, which I thought the show did well. As a scuba diver, it is my goal to dive the Great Barrier Reef before it is ruined by sedimentary run-off from sugar cane plantation clay / fertilizer washing into the ocean, that coupled by global warming of the sea is already killing off a lot of the reef, jeopardizing the reef's inhabitants and killing tourism. What I did not learn, until watching this anime, is Okinawa's ""Emerald Seas"" are due to it's thriving reef eco-system, which one character said was better than the Great Barrier Reef. Now because of this show Okinawa has made it onto the list of ""places to dive before I die"".The other thing I must mention is the love, care and reverence this anime shows us as the typical Japanese Food Tradition. It's not just the ingredients, their freshness and their medicinal or nutritional usage but also the preparation. Two things struck me in particular.1. The Pig's Feet and other Dishes contains gelatin and CHONDROITIN - if you have any older folks in your family you might be aware they take daily supplements of Glucosamine, chondroitin and MSM to relieve osteo-arthritis. A lot of older folks I know take this daily as missing a dose will result in the return of aches and pains in their joints. To find out Okinawans llive longer, pain free lives because their diet includes things that contain chondroitin naturally, without having to take pills ... well .. that explains A LOT!!2. There is a scene where Yamaoka ladles some of his food into a saucer and tastes from the saucer (not a tasting spoon) so he can use the ladle to continue stirring the food. This is food hygiene 101 plus efficiency as his lips only touch the saucer and it's practical to have 1 tasting saucer vs. 20 tasting spoons to wash. A ton of professional chefs don't even do this judging from the Food Network shows, so to see this in an anime is mind boggling.Gourmet Rating 9.0/10 - excellent, one of the best for preparation and cooking with instructions and recipes.07/10 Visual appeal of food - Not that great as the animation from the 1990s is super dated.10/10 Reaction of characters to food - REALITY. This is probably how real people would react when eating those types of food under those circumstances.09/10 Difficulty or complexity of food featured - Even simple recipes take time.10/10 Preparation or Cooking Instructions - 100% legitimate and educational, learned a lot.09/10 Desire of viewer to cook or buy dishes featured after watching show - Very high, only stopped by ingredients or cooking tools not being easily available.Overall 7.0/10It's a grand gourmet anime that has 100% focus on preparing, cooking and eating the food. There's a good story also but sadly the art does not justify giving this a higher rating.";Recommended

0;Kuma ni Kuwarenu Otoko;cyborgmug;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cyborgmug;3;My main issue with this short film from 1948 is how terrible it looks. Yes, it is from the 1940s, but films such as Tora-Chan from the previous year, Ari-chan from 1941 or Ahiru Rikusentai from 1940 all have much better, smoother and more expressive animation - and that’s not even mentioning the nicer-looking animations made in the 30s and 20s. This film’s animation is straight-up bad for its time, which is not helped by the genuinely unpleasant, grotesque character designs. The falling leaves are at least nicely animated.The story is not without its merits, with a couple of funny moments with the bear chasing one of the human characters. However, even for its meager length of 10 minutes it feels overlong and boring, in part due to the glacial animation.The sound at least is entirely fine.If you’re looking to watch old anime movies, skip this one.;Not Recommended
0;Aru Nihon no Ekaki Shounen;Keten;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Keten;10;"Recently added to MAL, I'm shocked by how little it's been seen by others despite winning many awards in various animation festivals. ""A Japanese Boy Who Draws"" is perhaps the most personal and genuine thing I've ever watched, which makes sense given it's partly an autobiography.This is however a review full of SPOILERS since it would be difficult to talk about an anime short without talking about what exactly it's about. With that said, I highly recommend it and it's only 20 minutes so give it a shot!Review:The most obvious trait of this short film is it's experimental art style and animation, having the style grow along with the protagonist as he ages and progresses more as an artist and mangaka. While this alone would make it stick out, it has an added charm of seemingly using the artists actual drawings from when they were a child, making it all feel very authentic and personal and all the better conveys the starting point of the protagonists journey.Added on to this, there are a plethora of different art styles that are blended together, everything from pixel-art to paintings to deviantart shitposts, there's even an appearance of a Dada piece(Anti-Art) by one Marcel Duchamp. It acts as both an homage to various forms of art as well as gives us quick insight into how the protagonist feels about those around him, whether it be drawing some like muscular shonen protagonists or crude artwork indicating his distaste for them or even drawing teachers of art in classic painting style to indicate his respect for them and what he learned from them.There's also another characters art featured, a friend from when the protagonist was a child who enjoyed drawing people with wrestling masks.You also get to see insight into the kinds of titles and mangaka the protagonist takes inspiration from, particularly experimental titles such as Lain and Evangelion or big accomplishments like Akira.This works into the story of the film nicely, as we see his passion for drawing leading him to become a mangaka himself and while he wants to follow in the footsteps of his heroes like Akira Toriyama or Osamu Tezuka, making something truly his own, he finds himself being brought down by the very industry he had such a passion for, slowly evolving in style to appease the crowd just to get by, leading him to art styles like Moe or Bishounen that you can clearly see his distaste for as he slowly loses the spark that he had when he was young.This even culminates in a particularly powerful scene where we see the protagonist sit on a bench with various famous mangaka. Normally this kind of scene would evoke some kind of inspirational message but it instead subverts that by giving insight into just how far the protagonists passion has fallen, having the famous mangaka telling the protagonist to quit drawing. Eventually he puts down his pen, giving up drawing and the art immediately shifts to greyed out live action, brilliantly conveys the lack of color in his life as he moves back in with his mother and takes on a passionless life.While all this is going on, we quickly move over to a character introduced earlier in the film, a friend from childhood who enjoyed drawing wrestling masks on people. While his skill has not progressed at all since then, the color of his artwork remained and upon hearing about the protagonists success and progression as an artist, sets up their old drawings in a museum. It's also of note that this character has down syndrome but it's never made out to be anything out of the ordinary, which I respected for not victimizing or treating it like some illness. Though I'll admit the character would have perhaps benefitted from some more screen time but works perfectly fine as a supporting character for a short film.Eventually the protagonist receives a pamphlet for the museum from his mother, the pamphlet being partly colored, the only colored thing shown from his point of view. Upon seeing these old artworks, all colored in completely, they remind the protagonist of fond memories back when he had fun drawing and watches as the next generation have begun their journey into drawing themselves.Seeing the pure love for what they do, the protagonist is reminded of what made him want to become a mangaka to begin with and so, fulfilling the desire of one of the kids by humorously drawing them ""boobs"", the color returns to his life and he goes on to continue his career, followed by credits featuring various drawings from what I assume are different times in his life that simply didn't make it into the film or perhaps drawings from his friends back in school.Verdict:I am not sure what could be changed about this film to make it any better besides perhaps a nitpick here or there or maybe a longer runtime but with the short time it had, it made me completely endeared to the protagonist, invested in his struggles and growth, rooting for his success and left me with a massive smile on my face.This is an incredible example of what makes animation and artwork so wonderful as a medium, using visual storytelling to convey so much character, story and emotion along with an inspiring message about improvement through hard work as well as finding and keeping love with what you do in the face of the hardships of reality. This is as personal and genuine as it gets and I wouldn't change anything about it.I hope to support the future works of Masanao Kawajiri.";Recommended
1;Aru Nihon no Ekaki Shounen;NextUniverse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NextUniverse;9;"TLDR at the bottom.We, as humans, aspire. There is a skill suited to us, or talent if you like, that we have the power to expand on, to expand against the great horizons of the Earth, some even going as far as to prove to humanity that they are the one with this amazing skill in their arsenal. But what does that road look like? I'd imagine people reading this (I'd actually be more surprised if anyone is reading this) consume media. Media has a tendency to exaggerate detail and flaunt aesthetics for the sake of engagement. It becomes unfeasible to decipher what works and what doesn't in our world, reality. The populace is known as ""hidden gems"", would like to contradict this train of thought.The challenger of today, being ""A Japanese Boy Who Draws"" (abbreviated to Nihon Ekaki)Nihon Ekaki is indeed a hidden gem in this medium, and I don't mean to throw that out there since I am sure countless titles do indeed come under the same populace. But Nihon Ekaki in particular is a lot different from anything I have seen. It first tells a story, one devoid of huge ambition, devoid of systematic drama, devoid of perplexing ideas, but still manages to set sail with watered-down versions of such dangers presented, just enough to warrant its praise in a high calibre. The pacing is well, and there is no poor writing. It really is a simple story about a boy, Shinji, and the growing up in his life with his talent of his. As I have mentioned earlier, media creators love to exaggerate, there is no blame there, however, Nihon Ekaki doesn't commit to what can be considered such treacherous behaviour. It truly is something of a genuine piece. That is to say the same for these characters as well, they behave like normal humans, with zero exaggeration for the purpose of engagement, that is to say, the engagement of realism is something in itself too. Characters like such tend to have an understanding of the what, the why, the how, diverging to a connection with the viewer, one devoid of any facade, as real characters should be. These guys are great characters overall.The visuals aren't just great, they are clever. As time changes, so do the style. When people give up on their ambitions, so does their style. Everything here is played in relativity, and it isn't clunky either, a good amount of what is seen isn't just there for the sake of it either, so there is no worry in visually broken visuals. I don't see quite a lot of creativity like this, though I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't original, it just doesn't look like something that has yet to have been touched upon prior to this movie. That is just intuitive thinking though. OST was pretty good, pretty sure it was just a piano for the most parts, which in itself merited for a good synergy in the movie, but I suppose it wasn't enough to be called the utmost best, it was fine of what it is though. Seiyuus sounded very human too and not like something out of a professional, very fitting for a movie like thin in all honesty. Great audiovisual here in all.I enjoyed this. I will admit, I liked the idea, a lot, but I didn't enjoy it as I think I would have, I just didn't I suppose. The concept is great and everything here is indeed masterful, however, it didn't correlate to my enjoyment. I still very much liked this, just not to reflect a 1:1 ratio between the idea (and how it was made) in respect to the reaction. That isn't to say you won't enjoy this, however, since I would imagine this a piece to be universally enjoyed.- ( . )( . )TLDR: Great short movie with a clever artistic presentation about the realism in one's life and choices that can affect down the line.Overall - 8.6 (9)----------So I haven't been reviewing seriously in god knows how long, I am not entirely sure if anyone even cares about me or what I am doing, but I am going to do some more stuff here on MAL.Anyways, I have been meaning to write a review on Nihon Ekaki for some time now but was super lazy in doing so. Finally got to it as of this upload date and it was something of a good rewatch to it too, not a lot to take out a second time other than this is pretty damn good for a short.

While it does have a coherent progression throughout its runtime, it never showcases his talent or his imagination and only goes from shitty scribbles to the most painfully generic comic artstyle ever. It only has a short segment inside an exhibition which actually blends styles with characters made in pixel art, paintings and cut-out photographs coexisting together that I enjoyed but aside from that, it ends up being something anyone could have done.It's also a bit strange that we also don't see our main protagonist being passionate about drawing nor about anyone in the industry, or actually we do see some of them but they're the ones literally every kid from the 90s knows about: Dragon Ball, Lain Eva, Akira... it really makes him bland and the textbook cliche of the kid drawing in the classroom and continuing in this path because he doesn't know what else to do in life. There isn't any wrong in trying to craft a ""relatable"" character but and it doesn't give us anything to root for and it seems like a story that has already been told a million times before.Aside of Shinji himself, it is also about his friendship with Masaru who's autistic/mentally disabled and the thematic contrast to the lead that he's used for could've worked if he had more than the one scene establishing their relations but his inclusion acts as a poor emotional device that we're supposed to feel empathetic about for the sole fact that he's retarded and the sad piano music playing is pretty laughable.Aru Nihon no Ekaki Shounen had plenty of ideas but simply missed fleshing them out, a slightly lenghtier movie could have fixed a lot of them and make me more invested so I will still look out for Masanao Kawajiri next project, Cherry and Virgin.";Not Recommended

This OVA series was made by the company called Magic Bus and it is surprising how this animation studio has come from making things like Legend of The Galactic Heroes to Short Porn Series. So here it is a series done in between those productions and it was very enjoyable but as with many series it didn't have a continuation.The story of P-Hyoro is about 4 siblings who are monks and they take comissions in exorcising and cleaning places and people from evil spirits and that's practically it. The story is very enjoyable there is nothing amazing but it gets the job done but there is a problem, this show from the beginning was setting like an arc about a girl looking from behind every sibling and informs the situation to her boss but it results in nothing. It is not explained at all and the way the show finishes it just stops and that specific plot point is not explained at all. At the end of the series you get a message that you should support the show and manga but it seems that the support wasn't enough for this to continue.The charactes are really good. Even if the show is short, every character has traits that make them easy to remember. Kota acts the leader and more rational one.Qta that is the beautiful of the family and girls are around him when he doesn't like it. Kyota that is the youngest that has a lot of energy and goes to school and Ryoko that is the serious one and is the oldest of all. The dynamic these siblings have is amazing and really enjoyable throught the course of the series. They really engage like a family and even joke around.It feels really proper for the show.The Art is good. It has the typical shoujo feel from that era. It is good and really amazing. The evil spirits really are off putting and they show how horrible they are. Also the action is decent and there are no weird frames in between. It is simple a great experience watching it and seeing the best from the 1980s animation.The voice actors are decent. The soundtrack only appears whenever there is an action scene. The opening is acceptable and the ending is meh. But it is ok.This OVA is good. If you want to see a show about evil spirits and a good dynamic between siblings from the 1980s. It is great that series like this are being covered because months ago it was impossible to find.Take care in whatever you do and this will be my final review for 2019.;Recommended
1;Gensei Shugoshin P-hyoro Ikka;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;7;"Although it is rife with cliches and cheesy dialogue, P-hyoro Ikka is fun to watch, and reminds me of Ghost Hunt and Ronin Warriors, with a bit of Bubblegum Crisis mixed in.This 3-episode OVA is about the four Shinohara siblings, who are actually the ""P-hyoro"" family, monk-like guardian deities with supernatural powers. They receive requests from clients to perform exorcisms and the like. There is an overarching plot developing with a man and a woman who are in another realm and have connections to the siblings, but these connections remain unexplained. (The woman, Yogi, looks a lot like a grown-up Youko from Genmu Senki Leda, by the way.)The show has a mix of supernatural, mystery, horror and comedy elements. At times, the cheesy dialogue coupled with the Rose of Versailles-esque character designs (same character designer) makes some scenes particularly ridiculous. The plot progression can be a bit jumbled and deus ex machinas abound, but the episodes are enjoyable enough if you don't think too hard about it. But unfortunately, just when the overarching plot is starting to come into play, the series abruptly ends.Music- and sound-wise, the opening is an upbeat tune, but isn't all that memorable. The visuals mainly show the 4 siblings posing and turning towards the camera, and it's kind of silly. The ending is a rather generic instrumental electro-synthpop number with images of Yogi posing in various positions for whatever reason. As for the voice acting, the main character, Kyota, is voiced by Kazuki Yao, who is ever-present in these '80s OVAs, and a lot of other popular '80s voice actors are in this one as well, such as Keiko Toda, Miina Tominaga and Kaneto Shiozawa. The voice acting is decent, but rather uninspired and not easily distinguishable from other works these actors are in. Also, in the first episode, one of the side characters has an absolutely hilarious voice that just doesn't fit the character and made me burst out laughing when I first heard it.As for animation, the characters look like they come straight out of Rose of Versailles, but it works somehow. So the art is good. The animation is mostly fluid, but there are a few instances in which characters speak but their mouths don't move, and there are a few recycled scenes (like when the siblings show up to exorcise a demon). A warning to the photosensitive out there -- there are some flashing lights, but the scenes they get used in are predictable, so it's not too much of an issue.Overall, I found myself enjoying this short series more than I thought I would. I liked the character designs, and thought the siblings' interactions with one another were heartwarming. Even though the series was only 3 episodes, I was able to sympathize with the characters, and I was left wanting to know more about the siblings' pasts and who the pink-haired woman and blue-haired guy are to them. As of this writing, the manga in its entirety (including the two sequel series) is available for free, legally, online (in Japanese), so I guess that's where I'm heading to find out what happens next in the story.Worth a watch!";Recommended

0;Shinsetsu Kachikachi Yama;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;5;A dedicated riff off Disney and Fleischer, Mt. Kachikachi has nothing particularly interesting to write home about. The flimsy damsel in distress plot seems to have been lifted directly from the likes of Mickey mouse and the characters seem to remind you of a mixture of Disney's more popular works coupled with some looney toons characters.The short work makes frequent use of repeated frames contrasted by shifting backgrounds to pad the length, setting the stage for today's time constrained techniques employed by the animation industry in Japan to churn out product. On the whole it is ineffably enjoyable for what it is, but doesn't provoke any deeper meaning nor does it really provide an interesting perspective about Japan. It seems like a wholescale attempt at replicating the American product for Japanese audiences without any adaptation.;Mixed Feelings
0;Si Hai Jing Qi;iamKetranLang;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iamKetranLang;10;A fun short tale of the seas. Each episode goes by fast and fulfilling.The Emperor of China on a sea expedition was killed by the backstabbing Navy commander. The Prince witnessed it and now the Navy commander wants him dead too. The Prince manages to escape aboard the Qinglong, a spirit ship powered by his father's jade seal. Itching to get the Prince are the Chinese Navy, the Japanese shogunate, and the Indian Pirates.In the battle of the seas, the Prince banded together with many foes and allies. Indian Pirate leader that was going to capture and sell the Prince is so strong and so badass. He the most epic, can command and ride sharks, and I like his style of fighting. Good character design and I like to stress he easily the best character!I love the theatrical opening in this donghua. It's like watching something you'd experience on big screen or in a movie theater. The opening is so grand and the beautiful CGI played in slow frames and the epic background music (no singing) feels so HDTV. Dragon's Dogma has an opening like this too if you interested ~Si Hai Jing Qi is amazing and beautiful 3D CGI, fun and simple to watch for a good time!;Recommended
0;Si Hai Jing Qi;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;5;"Beyond the Ocean is billed as an anime featuring naval and pirate warfare, but it doesn't quite live up to its ambition. The story had potential: A prince witnesses the state advisor, his teacher, kill the emperor in an argument, and is framed for the kill; he eventually attracts a ragtag group to achieve revenge. However, there are numerous directorial problems in its execution that distracts from immersion of this epic synopsis.First, the show sports a number of villains of other ethnicities in bad stereotypes that make it seem borderline racist. For example, the Japanese villain has a faceless shogun surrounded by lava and effeminate ninjas that look like Orochimaru. The European traveler is book smart but dimwitted.Perhaps more pertinently, the naval warfare aspect looks silly when some of the ships are indestructible despite taking direct canon hits, while some ships charge through other ships like a battering ram and change directions arbitrarily like a video game controlled by a joystick.It doesn't help that prominent characters tend to space out in important moments. Like when the protagonist, the prince, spaces out while an enemy ship approaches his and hooks it with grapples, instead of commanding his magical ship to pull away. One of the pirates space out in an important fight, allowing the enemy to retreat.Much of these moments are probably intended to dramatize the scenes, but are poorly executed, so instead makes for a frustratingly unreliable narrative, if you give it benefit of the doubt.The protagonists are thrown together under rather silly circumstances, and the union is poorly justified. They do gain some camaraderie as the show goes on, but individually they don't have legs to stand on. There is the prince who is so hellbent on revenge, yet he is weak and indecisive when it comes to actually killing anyone. There is the Mongolian brute who only tags along because the prince damaged his boat, and he wants him to buy a new one. There is a Japanese ninja tsundere with a mysterious back story. And then that European guy, because he just really wants to ride the protagonist's ship.If all these sound like shounen tropes, well, that's the maturity level of this story. And it's unfortunate, because going into the first couple episodes, I had such high hopes that were dashed by episode 3. It's not terrible, it's just more of a turn your mind off sort of adventure, that could have been easily improved if the characters had more genuine expression, if the foreign villains are depicted less like cartoons (together with the cliche ""muhahaha"" laugh), and the action sequences are inspired by the modicum of research or detail.";Mixed Feelings

I WANT TO KNOW! Well, nothing much, if you are not a freak obsessed with the history of animation, I recommend you to pass from this short created way before the concept of anime series was a thing.The beginnings of animation were of course waaaay too different to what we see today, with many movies like this having just an experimental purpose rather than to be shown to a massive public. ""?"" is a perfect example of this. In summary it's just three shorts showing whatever could be done with animation in 1932, which might have seen impressive at the time but nowadays, 90 years later (at the time of writing) has been forgotten and just seen by people interested in such niche stuff.Of all the three shorts, Trump no Arasoi is the only one that had at least... something noticeable to tell, some sort of romance with poker card symbols and a fight?

There is no DVD, Bluray, or digital release of any sort in English that I know of, and that's very unfortunate. It's a fairly generic coming-of-age story, but for children, it's delivered in a paced, interesting way that keeps kids engaged. This movie makes you really feel, and want to be a better person. When it comes to kid's movies, you can't ask for much more than that.I'm giving this a 9/10 based on my childhood opinion.

I say this because if you do have that knowledge going into this then it may make this particular movie of the series a bit difficult to watch as their are more deviations from the source material than there were in the first movie.The animation is decent for the period, but is is not stellar by any accounts. The voice acting is done well enough and there are some likable character portrayals. But that feels like the lowest bar it needed to cross to at least be worth finishing after I started it.The climax and ending felt a bit lack luster which is a shame because these events are tragic and there was a chance for them to really lean into that tragedy but they just missed the mark.Plus the actual end of this film is so a-historical and not even close to the literary telling of the ROTK that they have to throw some text at you right before the ending theme so you aren't let confused by where the chose to hit the stop button.There are better adaptations out there so please check those out and maybe save this one for a hate watch once you are familiar with the story.;Not Recommended

Kind of a short film.A bit of a surreal piece tbh. Cute though. The animation/art at certain points was a bit wonky, but overall was pretty good. The only criticism was that at some points, the main character's head looked squished/oddly oblongated due to the animation style, but except for the awkward head, everything else was drawn beautifully. Each still was as pretty as a painting. Ya know, the kind of thing people would turn into desktop wallpapers and such.The art was beautiful, the music was well-timed, the male character was pretty interesting, in an existential sort of way. It's not overly depressing either. Sure it seems like it initially, but you quickly realize through the art and music, it's not meant to be depressing.Overall, it was a cute piece.

I've never played any of the Rebirth games that this OVA was based on, so taken out of context, none of these scenes make much sense to me.The story is presented in a really haphazard manner. Each scene is broken up by a narrator accompanied by a screen full of text, making them all seem disconnected from each other. This also makes the story difficult to follow, and it seems more like a collection of animated cutscenes that could have probably been in the game.The audio is well done, but didn't blow me away, voice actors deliver their lines fine, and sound effects sound good enough.

This is basically the same thing, only written about half a decade earlier, only focusing less on the personal problems of the students and more about the troublemakers.Or so it seems, as the plot basically gets abandoned for a more traditional Yakuza plot in the second half of the OVA. Both halves are good enough, but could have been both improved on.Art: 6/10High School Jingi is animated in a typical late 80s/Early 90s artstyle, but borrowing from several other styles such as one reminiscent of Leiji Matsumoto's in one scene for example. The character designs are also blocky and simple. I think it's quite charming, despite looking way cheaper than the average production. Unfortunately, the female characters look kinda horrible from a regular distance, due to poorly drawn noses.Sound: 6/10The soundtrack is a contemporary synthpop influenced one, which in my opinion makes it automatically good until proven otherwise. Nevertheless it's quite standard. Unfortunately, the Ending theme is quite a mediocre song.Characters: 7/10The main character of this OVA is basically Eikichi Onizuka, but with nicer yet simultaneously way scarier and sleazier, while pulling combat moves straight out of the Ryu Ga Gotoku video games. Nevertheless, he's a fun main character. The secondary characters matter little.Enjoyment: 7/10It's quite a fun way to spend 50 minutes with some mindless fun. Its funny, it's charming and surprisingly less perverted than could be deducted from one of the first scenes. I quite liked it.Overall: 6,5/10I liked it, though it's probably not the best anime.;Recommended
0;Oi! Ryouma;-rojazu-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-rojazu-;7;"My wife, who is Japanese, recommended we watch this anime together as she had fond memories of watching it as a child. I'm not one to write reviews, but as nobody else has I felt it was my duty to do so - and hope it will be to the benefit of others who stumble across this hidden little gem.The anime covers the Japanese revolution, also referred to as Bakumatsu Period, which translates to ""end of the Shogunate"" - anyone with an interest in Japan will surely want to study that period of time from the history books - but rather than that I would recommend this anime as one of the best places to start. There is no need for me to delve into the details regarding the historical context or the plotline of what this anime is about - just read the synopsis. Instead I will focus on some elements that stood out for me, and summarise my overall thoughts on why you should watch this anime.Ryouma is not glorified as some all conquering hero as one might see in Western stories - quite the opposite - he is in fact a very ordinary man. It is a typically Japanese trait to be humble and show humility and this anime does exactly that throughout with respect to Ryouma. The story presents his entire life, starting from his childhood, where he was known to have been a coward, a bedwetter, borderline illiterate and unable to do anything properly, to his final days where his independent position enabled him to forge alliances and compromises between Japan's greatest leaders allowing his country break free of the feudal structure and towards the more modern interpretation of society we see today. This growth and transformation of Ryouma really gives the viewer some insight into his life, and in particular his relationship with his older sister (psuedo-mother) Otome, who is both the driving force and the rock that supports him during this transition.The presentation is quite childlike, which does not deter from its appeal, in fact I think it makes it more accessible. The art style is simple but genuine, and the likeness of the characters is captured well compared to their real life photos. For the most part the anime showcases the historical events with incredibly accuracy and the characters themselves come across as extremely authentic. There are plenty of humorous moments that punctuate the dramatic events that lead to Ryouma seeking a new world - some of which are incredibly tragic and the anime does not hold back when it comes to the raw and emotive scenes. The brutality of the period is well known. Over and above that through every interaction - be it a Kendo sword fight, an encounter with a foreigner, or protecting others to the detriment of himself - Ryouma's charm and charisma comes across in particular, as he seems to touch all those he encounters which his strong sense of justice and authenticity.Finally the biggest merit to this anime is the amazing research that has been done on Sakamoto Ryouma. It can be legitimately considered an excellent biography, as well as an excellent history book on the Bakumatsu Period. But in contrast to history books and biographies, it does one more thing, it brings Sakamoto Ryouma and his dreams, as well as the time he lived in back to life in a human and relatable way, which is so much more important that knowing some facts about history... You don't learn from history by knowing times and events, you learn from history by living through it.[As a word of warning - I could not find any subs for this anime, so it had to be consumed Raw, so you will need some comprehension of Japanese to understand this fully, although given the accessibility of the presentation I would not let that deter you.]Overall Rating: Good, and a must watch for anyone interested in learning more about the events and context surrounding the Japanese revolution and an honest and inspiring presentation of the man that was Sakamoto Ryouma.";Recommended

0;Xun Jian;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;3;"This apparently has a novel, but I have no intention of reading it (for now at least), so I won't be speaking to how this donghua does as an adaptation.This donghua is something I classify as a ""trash tier"" donghua. I don't mean this is bad or trash, it is a classification that I assign for donghua that have short episodes (content usually ~5 mins of actual animation after cutting OP, ED and PV), and are clearly very low budget. This donghua has slightly longer episodes than the 5 min ones but not by much and it's really too short. It's watching experience is made even worse by the fact that it is seasonal and has 12 episodes in this season. Hopefully it will be better in the future, but for now, there isn't even much to watch. If you did a straight watch without skipping the OP, ED, etc, you would probably spend the same amount of time watching those as the actual content.When it comes to the plot of Xun Jian, it feels very generic, and has poor execution (I won't fault it for being generic though). OP/gifted MC, has a romantic interest, arrogant young masters, some master villain plot. There isn't really anything about it that stands out. Now if you consider the short scenes and very disconnected nature of the plot building, it gets really confusing. Scenes jump from place to place and character to character making it feel disjointed. There are way too many characters to pay attention to for the runtime of the episodes.The character models for this donghua are alright, they seem to be very generic, almost like stock donghua characters. They are not unique in any way, probably given the low budget, but are still acceptable. The animation quality, however, is very low. The beasts/animals feel run/move like PS2 or PS1 era games (the lion reminded me of Red XII from the original Final Fantasy 7 game). The action scenes are slow and even the more intense ones don't really have any impact; there aren't any ""collisions"" that feel like they have substance behind them. The characters themselves fall very flat. Like I mentioned earlier, because of the multitude of characters, they get give little screen time to all of them, making them lack development. Instead, attitudes can flip flop easily (like with the ""FMC""). The only one that feels like it makes sense is the little sister, who is probably still relatively young and felt like the MC was a hero after being saved by him. The others, like the FMC, feels dismissive/hostile to the MC and agreed to the marriage because it was a convienent way to avoid proposals from others but acts a bit ""tsun"" later to him? There are also characters that just kind of show up and then get killed, ones that look like they could be interesting. Then there are the fights and power levels; early on the FMC couldn't beat that arrogant young master, but later she can beat that person's father? The MC seems to struggle in the final fight against the female antagonist, but somehow takes out a skill that restrains her so that he wins without any indication or buildup leading up to that? None of these make sense at all.I usually don't comment too much on sound quality or voice acting, but in this donghua, I have to do so. Some of the ""screaming"" drags on too long and there is no inflection or anything. Much of the delivery is also flat, making it feel emotionless. It just feels off from whatever they are trying to portray.This donghua, is barely passable as a watch, at least this adapatation of it. The episodes and season are too short to actually have any meaningful development of plot or characters. They try to cram too much into this short run-time so it feels like nothing much is gained even from watching it. You can get a vague outline of the plot but it's just a skeleton. There's so little that I couldn't even get attached to the plot or any of the characters, which these types of stories revolve around. Since this donghua is an adaptation, I hope the actualy novel (source) is better at explaining/expanding on plot, characters, motivations, setting, etc. For now, this donghua is not really worth watching. Perhaps that might change in the future when there are more episodes (because greater plot/buildup), but right now it is not.";Not Recommended

This show is really goofy and anyone who is not a young kid will most likely find it really strange and not worth watching. Even for kids I wouldn't recommend it as it is one of the worse kids shows out there as well. The animation style is very unique from most anime as it is 3D animated instead of 2D. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing I will leave that up to you. (Not that the CGI was outstanding or anything.) This show is one of those fast goofy comedies where there is so much going on so fast. The jokes they use are really cheesy but the cheesiness of them sort of suits the show. Just imagine a show that people decide to watch for no better reason than to see how corny it is because that is a pretty good representation of this show. However, there is one really awesome pun used at the end of the show. (a character gets called a guacamoron) I give this show a 2/10;Not Recommended

0;Tenshi no Habataki Jun;5Cats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/5Cats;1;It takes a special kind of terrible to get a 5 average on MAL, this short OVA is just that bad!It's supposedly about the love between a father and his daughter, but it's just 2 sex scenes and a brief ending.There is no sound effects, no music (until the last minute or so) and some really bad animation. Only the voices of the two characters. Other than that? It's bad! So bad you simply must watch it to be fully understood just how bad a 27 minute show can be.Scene -1: Cute girl is masturbating with a pencil on a bed. The clothing she wears keeps jumping from the 3 main views, 2 have her breasts covered and 1 has one breast exposed. The same art is used repeatedly throughout the show with little or no variation. Backgrounds are often colourful smudges.Her dad watches this through the partly open doorway, waits until she's finished, then walks in. She's not even remotely alarmed. They talk briefly then he fingers her (lends a hand!) and gets a BJ.Scene -2: Cute girl is watering the garden, sprays water on herself by accident and decides to strip those wet clothes off. Dad comes by and they have sex.There's a short montage of the two having lots and lots of different sorts of sex at the end, the only time there is background music.It's terrible, not sexy at all, the art is not synced to the voices and there's literally nothing good about it.

0;Akuma no Kairozu;inim;https://myanimelist.net/profile/inim;2;"**DO NOT WATCH IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY / SENSITIVITY TO BRIGHT FLASHING LIGHTS**TL;DR: Experimental short showing camera focus on a remote building circling around it in a distance. Another take on Itou's main theme, space and movement. Not completely sure I would call it an animation, because while having some artificial contouring in it, 95% is regular real world footage.Story: The center of the short is a skyscraper building in some densely populated Japanese city. The short is divided into several parts, each dedicated to some experimental visual about it. In the beginning and the end of the movie, normal images of the building are show, such as a view from the top. One segment outlines live footage of buildings for a technical drawing effect. This then is mixed with differently altered footage of the same camera shot (colors, outlines, luminosity, brightness) for a stroboscope effect. The main segment is a circle walk/drive around the skyscraper in a few 100 meters distance of it. Camera shots are cut together so that the skyscraper remains still and smoothly rotates. This causes the foreground buildings to hectically jump, creating a hectic mood. While I am sure the production was technically challenging, the overall idea is not really genius. 3/10Animation: Much of the short relies on cutting and camera position, not on animation. The score would be much higher if the cutting was relevant, which I think it is not for an animation database review. The outline effect may count as animation, but this is nothing photoshop can's do automatically. It may have been harder in 1988, but even then rotoscope was available and could do the trick. 1/10Sound: Repetitive mid-tempo ambient electronic music. It changes a little over time, but not much. Not supporting the images too well. It adds unrest and unsettling. So some work in the sound department, but nothing even close to a master musician. 2/10Character: The main ""characters"" are the building, the movement, and the unrest. 3/10Enjoyment: Not really. I appreciate the high effort, but it fails to entertain me or to provoke thought. If I want a stroboscopic effect, I rather watch something else. Not Itou's best work. 1/10Overall: (3+1+2+3+1)/5=1.8, rounded up to 2/10. I resist the urge to subtract one because this pretty much camp level, and my 1 is reserved for even worse.";Not Recommended

0;Uchi no 3 Shimai;ooReiko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ooReiko;10;"Story of the series is quite simple as it focuses on mainly the Mother and her 3 daughters and their relationship as the daughters grow throughout the series. It is very endearing to see them grow and the finale of the series is very rewarding in that aspect.Keep in mind that the second season episodes 103-141 consist of side stories and rebroadcasts that happen chronologically before the episode 102 which is the finale.Comedy is top tier and I think it really handles the relationship between parent and their kids really well and uses that as an advantage on many comedic and emotional situations.I'd say that the characters are probably the biggest strength of the series as the daughters and the dynamic between them and also between them and their parents makes the series very engaging to watch.There is Fuu the eldest daughter who has very imaginative mind and usually you see her playing as a princess or fairy. She also has a big sister role to her siblings which she takes pride in.There is Suu who is the middle daughter. She usually follows her big sister when it comes to playing and joins into her scenarios. You could say she is more tomboyish than Fuu. She also is ""free"" as described by the mother often.There is Chii who is the youngest also called the CEO by the mother because of her demanding attitude. She can't really speak that well but wants to take part in her sisters playing scenarios.The show utilises many broken Japanese structures and words as the kids don't know how to speak properly yet, which is really wholesome and pretty funny I'd say. The situational comedy usually relies on that kind of gimmicks.I haven't yet seen another series that does something like that and incorporates it part of the series structure as well as this series does. In many other anime the kids are usually big enough to atleast speak coherentlyI didn't really expect much going into it. Initially I only got interested in it after hearing the theme song and how catchy it was, later I was drawn into the family dynamic between the characters as Sazae-san, Chibi Maruko-chan etc do that really well so I was hoping something along those lines.Further I got I realised that it was more about parent and their kid dynamic than the extended family like the two others I mentioned. Kind of like young parent first kids type of scenario.

1;Senga Tsubo;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;5;Rate a 5English Subtitledart filmno vocals/soundStoryA story within a story. Both stories represent each other. The message from all of this is kind. The anime comments it as favors pay off. While in a way that works I find my take is a better explanation. Life is challenging. We rely on constant things to get by. I reckon no one is a stranger to the idea of wanting more of something. The problem of that greed is one forgets about balance. Sure, we could have more but is it really worth it? Will the ends justify the means?As for the ending it made me smile. Although it was not quite clear at first the end result as long as you stuck around you could figure it out. I suppose the idea of not being clear was intended. For it only builds on the main message of greed. Which was a wonderful touch.Art-black and white- An unfortunate mixture. I understand this was is an old film but the constant screen shakes, brightness issues, weird character expression/movements was quite appalling. Although, that is just a portion of the anime production. Some of the animations/drawings were done well like the minor characters.Characters-there a few moments of wonderfully crafted dialogue.

0;Shi Wan Ge Leng Xiaohua Movie 1;Mnemease;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mnemease;9;Ahh the movie that no one over the age of 40 should watch unless accompanied by a young person (quoted directly from one of the preliminary trailers). Shi Wan Ge Leng Xiao Hua (Shi Leng/十冷 for short) originally rose to fame as a web comic infamous for corrupting readers’ childhood memories in irreparable ways. As a continuation of the “99980 End of the World Arc” this movie is no exception to that rule.Story: The story begins in media res with an unnamed protagonist facing the consequences of his actions from the previous arc in which he essentially blew up the Earth. In taking what seems to be a quick solution to his problem, he only deepens his dilemma, and the only way to resolve things is to work with a team of other rather quirky characters to restore order to the universe before it is too late. Meanwhile, in addition to fighting some ever-persistent antagonists, the protagonist also has to confront his own self-confidence issues. Overall, while it’s certainly not the most original, the storyline is quite decently executed.Art: This is perhaps one of the weaker aspects of this film. Given the budget and the fact that much of the 2D animation industry in China is still stuck on the mindset that they should only make stories for children, it’s understandable that some of the action sequences are little on the stiffer side. Overall though, it’s definitely quite watchable, and I enjoyed the expressiveness of the characters as well as their designs.Sound: What do I say? I love Chinese voice acting. I never knew it was possible to express so much passion while ranting at a rate of 10 words per second, but somehow the ShengYou/Seiyuu make it work. While the music department is a fair bit weaker in comparison, the existence of the Time Machine Chicken alone probably makes up for it many fold.Character: Another quality that I love about the series - the characters have such interesting settings! Take for instance General Li/李靖, who, despite being an amazing swordsman, can never engage a fellow human in a duel because any blade he wields will inevitably end up caught in someone else’s hands (百分百空手接白刃). Or the unnamed protagonist who collects power in his ahoge based on the amount of ranting he does about the stupid actions that he perceives (吐槽能量收集). All of the characters have some quality about them that, when brought together, generate very humorous dynamics. In addition to fun interactions, I also really appreciate how each character is able to resourcefully utilize his/her unique skill, sometimes in rather creative ways. Overall, the movie is very strong in this area.Enjoyment: The movie is arguably more enjoyable than the short monthly anime episodes. Sure the episodes contain more inappropriate content which contribute heavily to the humor. However, the movie manages to be pretty funny even without those elements, so I count that as a pretty big success. I also really like the fact that the movie actually has a theme that is emphasized throughout, and how it ends full circle from where it started. There’s even a little bit of character development, which is rare for this series.Overall, I definitely recommend this movie. It may be best to watch the first two seasons of Shi Leng before this, because while this movie can be enjoyed an independent unit (it certainly recaps everything important), there are many references to the ONA/manhua that you might miss out on if you don’t watch/read it first. (That being said, I discourage watching season 3...which in my opinion really only existed to promote movie 2).Finally, I will end with a quote from the second Shi Leng movie that I believe gives a good taste of the flavor of series. “At the origin of the universe there is a point if infinite mass called the laughing point/笑点. When poked, this point explodes into two kinds of energy: the energy of pointless stupidity/犯二 and the energy of pointed mockery/吐槽, which together form the basis of all matter - the 梗. And when the mass and density of this 梗 increases to an overwhelming size, it can form a Brain Hole/脑洞 with the potential to both create and destroy the entire universe.”;Recommended

Artworks looping is appropriate given the art style of blending images. Blending images is my way of putting how one art picture can morph into another before turning back to its original form. Although, i found the looping processes to be a tad long (overdone).I enjoyed the concept of how the animation gave you proper notification that the end is arriving before it ended. This can only be caught if you truly paid attention to the introduction. Which makes total sense. A piece should end in relation to its beginning in some manner or form.SoundGenerally okay. The music did to match the art's mood. Main negative is the some what constant break in audio. It appeared to happen during the transitional art changes.

0;Atelier Petros Joukuu Gekijou: Sentaku Shima no Sentaku Tori;OffColfax;https://myanimelist.net/profile/OffColfax;1;Tucked into an inconveniently located corner of the Shibuya district lies The Village Of Marchen. It's not an actual village, but instead an stop-motion animation studio crossed with a Flash-based animation studio that is further crossed with a music recording studio. Offering classes in the various stop-motion skills to anyone who wishes to learn such a relatively obscure skill, as well as classes in Flash animation for those who for some obscure reason desperately want to learn how to become big on the internet's ancient dinosaur of a platform, The Village Of Marchen sits quietly and dreams of the day that it might once again become relevant to the rest of the world. The studio has put out some rather impressive animation pieces such as Worku that strive to, if not push beyond, then at least try to find the boundaries of the medium in a way that artists like Nagao Takena never will.Without the little (for lack of a better word to describe it) plot synopsis on the MAL page, this would be confusing as all hell. The Wash Bird flies around looking for laundry to do, then brings it back to The Wash Island for it to be cleaned. Unfortunately there is no actual indication as to what is being done for the first third of the piece, leaving the audience confused as to what that bird is doing flying up to a seemingly random... thing... beast... contraption... boat... whatever. After receiving a shirt from something that was inside the whatever, the bird flies back to the island. And that's when they turn the absurdity dial up to eleven and break off the knob.With no dialogue and only an attempt at basic sound effects (which is even more odd given that they have a recording studio on site), you have to rely more and more on the animation to carry the story. That problem becomes worse when the animation flies about as well as a lump of clay pushed off the edge of a table. Between poorly-designed models, horrifyingly basic stop-motion, and hacked-together footage, it is just horrendous all the way around. And that problem becomes even more worse when you realize that the story that all of the above was meant to convey had less impact and than watching someone mow a lawn. Which is saying something, as I've seen animation about lawn mowing that made it look absolutely fascinating in comparison to the real thing.And when you put all of those failures into the whole of the piece, it becomes worse than a failure. It becomes a mistake.;Not Recommended

I think the themes at play - hunger, lack of resources, difficult environments seemed to represent the overwhelming sentiment of the Japanese empire at the time - one of expansionism to justify the sustenance of the civilization.This short film is available in the public domain thanks to the efforts of the Japanese Animated Film Classics subdivision of the Japanese Archive.

And yeah, this 52yo anime is terrible in any way and even it's age does not helping. It was bad back then, it's even worse now. That's the first negative review I wrote. Here's why...STORY: 3What a pathetic piece of shit. It's pretty hard to write anything more than it's already stated in the synopsis. Basically boy and his dog fighting evil forces to save the world. It contains some heavy fantasy, horror and typical shounen action but poorly mixed and waaaaaaaaay too long. Everything that Bouken Shounen Shadar contains would be much better in max 75ep anime, not twice longer.ART: 3My God, I know it's old, I'm usually the first one to defend classic art. But here basically everything failed, I had real troubles to get anything positive from it. Charcet design was terrible, looked like glued to the back themes. And that's the other thing, nor the locations nor buildings and whole hand-drawn backing images were nice, disappointing and barely visible in details. And trust me - it's not that common. I'm still stunned that this shit comes in full color.SOUND: 1Pathetic piece of crap. Dialogues barealy hearable, sync and voice works terribble, some of the worst sound mixing I've ever heard. Forgettable soundtrack, awful main theme and songs. Haven't encounter that bad crap in ages.CHARACTER: 3From poor desing to poor character develompment. I can stand poor art if there's nice characters and some good backstories. Our main character is a boy from nowhere, we know barely anything except of his exceptional strenght and that he's special. The heck authors were thinking? I don't know. Of course during the show we are able to meet him more and more and find out something more about his history. But it's nothing compared to the show leenght. On the other hand we have the boy's companion, the bloody dog? I never seen so useless sidekick. I wondering if he was just dropped here only to do some fanservice. Awful. Gallery of second-plan characters and enemies is so... boring and plastic even friends were literally full of cliches in 60s!ENJOYMENT: 2Dreadful. Just no. If not mine strict no drop policy I wpuld dropped it after forst 20 episodes. Zero enjoyment. Series have some high ups however, the last arc is quite enjoyable, but to go there u have go throught 130 (!!!!) episodes of terrible storytelling and ridiculous plot. It's still somewhere between 2 or 3. Just avoidabe af. I suggest to think few good times before u start watching that.OVERALL: 3Yeah, poor/very bad. Now lemme go with some honest info, I had the anime from various sources, mostly vhs rips from a friend, some arabic tv rips and few unkown italian episodes. Overall I had 5 missing episodes, I skipped 2 full eps by myself and I catched myself with speeding up watching by skipping in every episode few minutes of bullshit. AND I STILL WAS ON TRACK WITH PLOT AND NOTHING MISSED. How's about that? Amount of completely pointless episodes is stunning, u can easily skip between 20 episodes from 20 up to 40 and then easily go up to ep 55 then skip another 20 eps anf forward watching up to ep 100. Funniest part these are not fillers, these episodes are just pointless, giving nothing for the plot and are done just to fill the on-screen time. After ep 100 it's safe to skip whole 20 eps as after that starting the final arc which is really enjoyable, shame the whole series is not.So naah, if u don't want to waste your time just avoid this title, however it's availability is extremely limited and literally soon will be completely forgotten and lost. And yeah, I feel somehow sad because of that but that's what the series unfortunately deserves. I wanted to defend it but after thinking over that there's barely anything to defent, except last arc it's pathetic, awful and terrible piece of anime.And with that disappointing it's time to finish that review.See yall around with another old anime in my deck.;Not Recommended
0;Mu Wang Zhi Wang: Han Tie Dou;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;6;"Note: I've watched all 4 seasons of Mu Wang Zhi Wang before writing this review, also this review will contain spoilers for Season 1, as Season 2 continues almost the exact instance where Season 1 ended.This season is a direct sequel to the previous one, like previously stated; I suggest watching season 1 before watching this one if you haven't already since most of the characters that this season centers around are all introduced in season 1. This time, the two groups (raiders and guards) are targeting an ancient tomb in the mountains. As it turns out, the tomb clear medallion is a key to opening this tomb. In this season, the third party hinted at in the first season also makes an appearance (the imperial family). Because of the involvement of the imperial family now, we see an even greater emphasis on politics (as the imperial family can be split into at least two factions, each with their own goals).Overall, a decent and enjoyable watch. Nothing ground breaking however.";Recommended
0;Nakanaori;injecting_anime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/injecting_anime;10;"‘Nakanaori’, or ‘Reconciliation’; in theology, it is described as “the end of estrangement between a human and God as a result of the process of atonement.” And while we as humans have long been estranged from the Lord, a skilled animator from a small xenophobic island nation is here to, once again, bring us closer to Him.This anime is not like, nor unlike, anything you see with every passing season. On one hand, it is an animated Japanese film, thus making it an anime. That is a category it cannot escape. But right from the very start you will start to see differences. And I am talking about the very start. Like, before you even start it ‘start’. Because while you can easily watch currently airing shows either legally or illegally, this film will keep you on a lease. It keeps you excited. Because as of yet, I am still trying to find it.Having finally found it on a website that may very well be run by none other than the Russian mafia itself, you are presented with a bold first frame; it stares into your soul and screams “I am dark-coloured; I am me,” a fitting statement for a society where even mostly white frames can be coloured if they so desire.Not even three seconds later, more like two, it follows this statement up in an act of bravery. As it changes its colour right before our eyes and defines itself once more, not as an independent work of art, but as the product of a human mind.Before we can even process this sudden change in appearance, it offers us a crudely drawn girl. Most likely aged between eight to thirty-two. You can never be too sure when something has, as of yet, done nothing but surprise you.This girl, this artefact of human creativity, does not look at you. It acts like you are not there. It acts like there is a wall between you and her. Instead she focuses all her attention on the long-haired girl in front of her. Staring her down. Waiting for the right moment to strike. But wait, the new girl is not ready to accept defeat just yet. And, shocking the viewer, she draws a sword, which is, in contrast, lighter than anything we have laid our eyes upon before.Changing the scene it prepares to astonish the viewer with a devastating sword-fight, as it reveals that the girl we were originally introduced to drew her sword off-screen. In retrospect, I should have seen this coming. We already saw her reaching for something when it cut to the other girl, but my attention was diverted before I could even ponder over what this was foreshadowing.Not wasting a second, the two girls clash their swords. But instead of the tinnitus-inducing sound that two swords clashing often produces, it is more like cutlery coming into contact with each other.And this is really where the film shines. It sets expectations, it plays you like a fiddle, and when you think you know what is going to happen next, it extinguishes these expectations. But the flame of passion does not leave the viewer, the flames only rise further up and light up the sky.The fighting continues, and for a brief moment it looks like the two girls are complete equals, but even this was just trickery. As the long-haired girl gets the upper-hand, forcing her opponent to flee. But her adversary is not about to give up. And before she can even get a blow in, her opponent counter-attacks. For a brief moment the screen darkens, not showing us what followed. Luckily we are quickly released from this prison-like frame. And one of the girls gets a kick in.Before this, it looked like it would be a sword-only fight. And I will be honest with you, I expected nothing less. But once again the creator read me, read us. Thus he changed it up to keep it exciting.The kick allows for the brief but effectful counter-attack, and the kicker is forced to leave the scene. But her pursuer is not having it, and immediately follows her into the shallow water she was residing in.The scene dramatically changes once again, and we are shown more of the world. The debris suggest that the film is taking place in a destroyed world, a Godless world, perhaps?Not wanting to draw attention to this fact, it continues the fight like nothing happened. And the two girls show mastery in their respective fields. Inspiring their audience to better themselves, to save this world without a proper saviour.Now halfway the film, it changes things up once again. And the new terrain fills the screen with a cloud of particles as white as snow.And they both start running.Running from the fight.Running from the world.Running from each other.And most of all, running from themselves.But alas, they could not keep running. As they fall from the cliff they ran to they must have realised. Realised what caused this. Realised what will come from this. And realised how they have changed due to this fateful encounter.They keep fighting.Without an end in sight, they keep fighting. Swords clashing, they look each other in the eye. Both looking shocked, the long-haired girl’s swords gets broken into two separate pieces. This seems like it is the end for her.But even the girl who broke the sword is now looking shocked, as her opponent’s weaponry is becoming airborne. Even after it has landed, they are still looking. Looking for purpose, perhaps?Without the soaring sword, they look at the one thing left to look at; each other. They shake hands, realising that this fight, this match, was not the purpose they were looking for.Both smiling, the story ends like it stated; a white frame and a black text. And the film ends after, once again, reminding us who brought us this masterpiece.Now, I am decently critical. My average MAL rating has been hovering around a 6.5 for a while now. But even I am not sure what to do, what to do in a post-Nakanaori world. So I looked for the thing, the last person, I could turn to; God. I confessed my sins. I confessed my wrongdoings. And most of all, I asked for his forgiveness. Even though I may have watched ‘Keijo!!!!!!!!,’ even though I may have watched ‘Yosuga no Sora’, and even though my favourite non-sequel of last season was ‘Sakurada Reset’, I dropped ‘Eromanga-Sensei,’ and currently, that is all that matters.TL;DR: https://vimeo.com/25851204";Recommended
0;Nakanaori;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;4;Rate a 4No words or vocals are used with exception to title.StoryA true joke since there isn't one. We don't know most basic things. Such as where this takes place? What brought on the fight? Who each person is? What they are fighting for? What led to the quick change in decisive action? Too many questions are raised.Introduction wise one is immediately brought into a fight. When there should have been some sort of preceding event. One could say intro was rushed.Conclusion, does relate to the title of Reconciliation but at the same it doesn't. How can one expect to grasp a life lesson such as this through such a fast paced action piece? A proper conclusion would have been to be a tad more lengthy and make it clear why the characters have put aside their aggression. While it is true the art hints at why they ended it but depending on what motive(s) brought it on in the first place may not have made sense ending it there. Such as would you stop attacking if let's say you were fighting with the murder of your spouse?Also, with lack of character background the audience has noway of knowing who to be voting for.Art-background is for the most part lacking color.-Animation and overall art seems that of the work of the program paint. Which is a lack luster color program.AudioOn a positive note the sound effects were appropriate and on point.;Not Recommended

This is a prediction art.a little background on japanjapan like china has poor quality air thus resorting to face masks and such. Which makes sense when you think of it. Pick up a manufactured piece in your room chances are it is from china or japan or the popular hong kong. This should tell you that with a lot of pieces made from those places there would be a lot of factories. Now, refer to the bush president run. His opponent al gore had a brilliant point we are destroying our air zone. Sadly those foreign companies mentioned earlier are suffering first. Enough history moving on...artist's pointwith conditions showing no room of improving. I think i read or watch something stating to the effect of 2 percent permanent rise in temperature because of the harm we placed on the planet. anyways, the artist is saying eventually life wont grow such as plants and trees. Since we can not fly and staying on ground will be more risky then beneficial we have few choices. We can pack up and move to a new planet. Unlikely, since we have not really finished surveying. The most likely choice is to stay here but go underground. For a retrospective we will become ants. The artist further states that there will like their has been evolution. Which in turn will be stronger than us. It is unclear to me if we caused this new evolution or this will be the work of visitors on our planet taking advantage of our weak state.Overalla nice quick global warning cartoon based a real events.;Mixed Feelings
0;Milky Gal: Cats Ai;Muffed;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Muffed;4;My fellow degenerates,Today I bring you Milky Gal: Cats AiIt's not very good.Story: I think it's about three high schoolers who are also popular idols? Somehow nobody recognizes their faces once they wear a school uniform so the humans in this world are as equally braindead as the real world. The rest of the plot is them fucking one another or random guys. One of the guys knocks one girl down as he is so popular he was sprinting from the lusty ladies. Another guy I'm like 100% sure is a porn filmer who must be filming himself and the girl fucking to blackmail her later. The last guy is just some random school dipshyat. Fucking in the middle of the park may not be THAT unusual but at night? Isolated? Hell to the naw. Definitely about to get murdered by a knife hobo.Art: Pretty shit. Animation is not varied, fluid, or full of energy. Character designs are the bleh old-school ones.Sound: VA work is okay, some spotty lines but overall decent. They fucked up the moans though. They added an echo effect during H scenes to like...everything. I don't want to hear the moans echo. Bad. Stop. Music is generic orchestra-type shit.Character: Bright red hair girl, purple hair girl, brown(?) hair girl. No development other than they get fucked. It's not like they're virgins since I can assume they've had sex in the past with one another anyways. Three guys. Popular guy, porn guy, and fucko guy.Overall: There's way better. Moans aren't quality enough so it's a hard pass. H scenes aren't that stimulating unless you're desperate (me).With love, Muffed :3;Not Recommended
0;Sumikko Gurashi Movie 2;InshadiuS;https://myanimelist.net/profile/InshadiuS;9;This movie is the pinnacle of cuteness!The designs and animations of the characters are simply adorable and watching them interact with each other is pure joy. But can you fill a 65 minute movie with cuteness alone? Not really. Luckily, there's a surprisingly moving story, touching upon themes like homesickness, unfulfilled dreams, and making up for one's mistakes, so it's actually very relatable even for adults. The pace is kind of slow, but I didn't mind it. The resolution is great, because it has a touch of bittersweet. With that said - it's still primarily aimed at kids, and you'll notice especially with the narrator's childish way of speaking. By the way, the characters themselves don't talk - instead they have their dialogue written next to them. I liked this, because it preserves the pureness of the characters.Speaking of characters, they represent typical outcasts: We have an ice bear who's constantly freezing, a shrub of weed, leftover tapioca pearls and even a ball of dust (and many more). Watching them live through their daily struggles and mishaps will make you just wanna give them a hug and tell them it's ok :)All in all, I enjoyed this movie a lot, smiling throughout most of it and even teared up at times. I left the movie theater feeling like a more positive person. Would recommend!;Recommended
0;Zhan Qiannian;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;7;"This donghua is an adaptation of the manhua ZhanGuo QianNian published by Bilibili.Plot summary: The MC is a gaming streamer, likely a top-player as well, of a wuxia martial arts game. After recieving a bracelet modeled after an ingame item (believing it is for him to promote/advertise) he is sent isekai into the game world. He arrives in an alternate timeline China, where the assassination of the Qin Emperor prevented the unification of China and led to the continued war until the ""modern"" time. The MC uses the bracelet (artifact) and cultivates to live and rise up in this world.The setting can be considered a mix of Japanese isekai and Chinese cultivation stories. The MC does have a cheat, but not a OP broken cheat right off the bat. Instead he has to work/use his cheat to strengthen himself. Since it is in the historical fantasy genre, you can expect similar setting, presentation, speech and drama of historical dramas. Expect the more gradiose/long-winded political debates, cross class romance, romantic drama, etc. Intermixed is some decent comedy. The plot so far is not too deep, but we can clearly see there are things going on in the background that is being built up.The character models and art is good. The animation quality is also high; it is a bit childish, but that's fine. There are quite a few characters who will probably be main contributors to the plot, though most of the focus for now is on the MC as he gets stronger. This Season 1 can be could be considered a prologue to the story.If you like historical fantasy drama or cultivation type works, this is a good watch. I would recommend it.Now as an adaptation, this donghua is probably the closest I have ever seen to a ""perfect"" adaptation. One of the reasons for this is because the original work is a manhua, which has much more manuveurability in it's plot than a novel. Novels tend to require prioritization because of how detailed it can be, while manhuas have looser plots and require readers to ""fill in the holes"". That said, there are some noticable changes to the donghua plot. Part of it involves introducing certain characters eariler to build them up as an antagionist, quick recoveries from injuries to spare resources on animation. There does appear to be some details and dialogue left out that suggested the ""awakening"" that happened at the end. All the other changes made the plot develop more smoothly so they were all considered good changes.By the way, the donghua adapts manhua chapters 1-39.Adaptation score (how faithful to source): 8/10";Recommended

Well, there is, and it is this anime!Hello Kitty: Ringo no Mori to Parallel Town is another one of many anime from the Hello Kitty franchise.Why did I watch this anime? So... I wanted to have a Hello Kitty anime on the list. Just for this reason.The story is simple, but it can be fun if you take into consideration that it is an extremely childish anime.Kitty is searching for her sister, Mimmy who is in this other world. Generally, the anime follows the same formula in every episode: Kitty is searching for her sister, and Makkuro makes sure she can't find her. The anime has some small side plots with other characters, but that's basically it.I will be honest, I liked the plot twist at the end where it is revealed that Akuro is Mimmy being manipulated by Makkuro. And I also felt like a real layman for not realizing that earlier.Well, it's a nice Hello Kitty anime, considering that this is for kids.;Mixed Feelings

Not enjoyable to watch at all.Sound: There is no music at all. They also recorded the audio while a brother was getting a sick fade, because all you can hear is hairclippers. Moaning is okay, but I prefer the fake hentai moaning to presumably genuine moans. And I LOVE hearing a Japanese man whispering demonic chants into my ear while I watch a girl get fucked.

0;The Snack World (TV);Zzyli;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zzyli;6;"The Snack World is an anime designed as a tie-in to the game of the same name by Level-5. It's set in a ""casual fantasy"" world, with a mixture of fairytale and modern elements. There's both Cinderella and convenience stores, Snow White and smart phones. As at the time of my writing, there is no English translation beyond the first handful of episodes, I feel that a brief plot synopsis is appropriate to give readers a general idea of the series.The story follows the adventures of Chup and his companions Mayone, Pepperon, and Gob as they attempt various ridiculous and challenging quests with a long term goal of defeating the sinister and avaricious Vinegar Khan. The show follows the fairly tried-and-true shounen formula of failing, powering up and trying again to overcome difficulties.I did initially expect with a title of ""Snack World"" that there may be a focus on snacks and eating, but snacks in the world are actually small cards which you can use to summon allies to support you, and not things you eat. The series does not have a particularly strong food focus.The series has a rather unique visual style for a Japanese production, utilising 3DGC in order to create characters which are reminiscent of claymation. It's certainly not what I would expect when I think of anime, but I do think that the visuals are effective, and the characters and surroundings are lively, colourful, and expressive. It's difficult to compare this visual style to other series which I have seen, but while I don't think that I would like all anime to take this route, I didn't mind the style, especially owing to its novelty value.The series is definitely targeted at the audience of children and families, and as such the plot and characters are not especially in depth, but during the duration of the series, we do get to find out some things about their back story and why they're choosing to overcome these challenges. There's plenty of humour (mostly visual gags, slapstick and puns), and I found that the series also displayed a lively sense of adventure. I don't think that it goes beyond its intended audience, but if you are like me and enjoy series which are targeted at younger viewers, it is well-produced and at times charming. If you like other Level-5 franchises like Yokai Watch, or just generally enjoy fantasy/adventure anime for younger viewers, The Snack World may be a series you would like.";Mixed Feelings

A lot of them revolve around infidelity and animal abuse. At least there was no nudity in this one. Also, I guess this is an art design issue, but the cats just look creepy.

0;Hal & Bons;Paski;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Paski;3;Well I didnt really know what to expect when i watched this. based on the first episode alone i thought it was rather unique. kinda weird characters (especially the talking mochi). But my initial response to this CG show was rather decent. but..... it got old fast.Story: Well there really isnt a story. the 3 characters sit/stand on a couch and talk about random things. some comments were funny but overall it got really old really fast.Art: Hmm well the CG was kinda half-heartedly put together. there really isnt a whole lot of motion to speak of. essentially you dont need to even look at the video, if you can remember the three character voices, you can simply listen to the audio.Sound: Hmm.... It honestly sounds like 2 of the main characters are drunk throughout the entire series, which i guess makes sense because all the characters do is drink beer and make critical comments on mochi-kun. I actually rather enjoyed the opening. it is a tad childish but it has a certain charm to it.Characters: Initially i thought they all seemed pretty amusing, but oddly enough by the end of it i genuinely hated the two dogs. They just seem like a**holes. Mochi-kun was decent but got kind of annoying as well.Enjoyment: As a series it was pretty bad, but if you were to watch one episode and one only you might sort of like it. the series is kinda odd like that.Overall: I honestly wouldnt really recommend this to anyone. there really isnt any redeeming factors for it.;Not Recommended

0;Ookami Shounen Ken;LacrimaMosa666;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LacrimaMosa666;7;My mission of bringing to light forgotten animes hasn't stopped after terrible 1967s Bouken Shounen Shadar.Literally day after finishing Shadar i decided to go back iven further, to the year of Astro Boy, Fall 1963, one of 4 series that have been aired back then, Ookami Shounen Ken (rest 3 will come shortly after this one, I started already infamous Sennin Buraku). But let's comeback to the main title for today. And it's even tougher to review. The anime perfectly shows how our world has changed in last 6 decades. For better or not is up to you. It's tough to review because it was... good. Here's why.STORY: 6,5For starters - it's a mix of Tarzan, Jungle Book and some classic african tales. Story bout boy raised by wolves who's fighting evil people and animals and protecting his family, nature and his place. He's accompanied by two small wolves Chi Chi and Po Po during the whole show. Nothing original you may say, yeah, now keep in mind that we're talking bout 56yo anime. It's one of the oldest available online animes u can actually find. And still pretty good. Whole story, plots and main arcs are basically written over 86 25 minutes long episodes. And that's perfect size, not boring and definitely not too long/short. Plots are interesting, funny and educational. Perfect kids anime and great piece of animated history.ART: 6Wow, that's high, yeah. Probably even a bit too high, but I don't actually care. This black and white animation is suprisingly smooth, detailed and apart from it's age - suprisingly neat. Backgrounds are decent, character designs great, various and reliable. I loved as well pretty decent location planning and design. Yeah, there's few big flaws, like cutted animations, broken sync, using the same shots few times, but hey, this time I can justify it using it's age.SOUND: 4,5Yeah, as u already know, sound mix and editing wasn't the strongest part of animes back then. However I need to say one thing - I LOVETHIS BLOODY OP. Can actually sing it now. The voiceworks are decent however there's constanly visible problems with the voice sync and placing. Music is nice, but quality of the sound is terrible but this time I can at least hear themes. Nothing more to add here.CHARACTER: 7,5Strongest part ot the show. The Wolf Boy Ken is a lovely character, brave, smart, very catchy and funny. His helpers, amsll wolves Po Po and Chi Chi are just typical helpers with humour, some decent gags in the back and nice backstory. Rest of the whole family of the wolves are just hilarious, from the old wolf to the one-eye scaring one. All second plan characters are reliable basically, starting from bad white-men, stupid black community (I'll explain that later) on dangerous and lovely animals, both good and evil. Gallery of characters is huge and very nice. Psychology and all of the motives are clear, not complicated and visible. Nothing hidden,. No darkness and shocks.ENJOYMENT: 6,5Yeah, I enjoyed it to the point I spend another 32 hours watching the whole series without any rest basically. All 86 episodes in one go. And promised to myself that will finish this kind of watching. Well, I lost. Series is very entertaining, funny and lighthearted. Provides some proper nature-oriented education and teaches bout love and friendships. Didn't even felt that so much time had passed during watching.OVERALL: 7Yeah... but... now a bit bout controvery that this title can bring with it nowdays. It's very... racist. Unintentionally and of course nothing wrong, it's mostly the times when it was released. Strong race-fueled conflicts were popular all around the globe. That's why I wrote that above. Black people are mostly treated bit... harshly, sometimes u can even think that they're retarded. And even it's not that common it's still clearly visible and manny today can complain. This is kind of anime that would never came out today, even in Japan. Still great tho.There's many downs but for every weaker part comes two strong and/or funny ones. There's not much deep or big pacifist speeches, it's just celebration of freedom, love and nature at it's finest.I loved that much more than expected and hope for more suprises like that. It's after all typical adventure feel-good anime that will make u smile the whole screening.Great anime 56 years ago remains still pretty good today.I'll see u on track with another 1960s anime very soon.;Recommended
0;Yasashii Fue, Tori, Ishi;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;5;"Rate a 5Japanese rawart filmSlight warning: while the artwork does demonstrate some violence I suggest the younger kids watch this with their parents regardless. So, they can be properly taught the meaning of right and wrong. If they watch by themselves they can get the wrong idea.PlotEver play rock, paper, scissors? Or better yet heard the phrase, ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me"". If so the artwork combines those two gentle nature aspects to provide a message of good but wrapped in a kind of brutal fashion.Kids are mean. Honest and truly. I don't think it is because they intent to be but they do it out of improper teaching and being afraid for not fitting in. While i don't exactly condone this film for its use of violence i think the director has a good point in saying kids should watch this. Even if one's growing up isn't impacted with bullies or other harmful scenarios they can always be bystanders to someone's harmful event and help them.This film while direct tells a kind preceded message that doesn't require translation. If you treat one fairly you are a kind person. If you listen to a monster you are a monster yourself. All it takes for a cycle of violence is for a pure innocent person to stand up and make a change.ArtTo be fair if the market which it currently is for kids you should dress the scenario in a more lighter tone. Than again if you doll it up too much the message because a joke as apposed to important. At least there was no blood more like bruises instead.Overall: If you are a parent and are debating if your child should watch this first decide on two aspects. One is your child able to handle the cold reality of the world? Second, are you a parent who believes in tough love? If the answer to both is yes then by all means this would be a good film for your child. Just make sure you are present.";Mixed Feelings
0;Chiisana Jumbo;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;6;Somebody watched waaaaaay to much Yellow Submarine before they animated this.Sanrio got really, really trippy in the Seventies, and it definitely shows in this 30-minute three-act operetta. Set on an idyllic, uncharted island, where there is want for nothing and everyone is happy, one day a young boy and his pet trained elephant show up to entertain them (Act 1). Before long, however, war breaks out between two other islands on either side, and this little slice of paradise is stuck in the battleground (Act 2), where the young boy has to make some very tough choices with his unwittingly-always-happy companion. How will everyone turn out in the aftermath of the war? (Act 3).Very well animated, as Sanrio was starting to come into its own. It's almost all song-and-dance from beginning to end. A cute little diversion from the usual anime fare, even the horrors of war had an element of cuteness (with the bullets with faces). Then again, it is Sanrio, after all.;Mixed Feelings
0;Guan Hai Ce;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;7;"There is a large war brewing up involving two large kingdoms in Ancient China. The Kingdom of Ji lies south of the Kingdom of Qu Tu separated by large cliffs; the only way for Qu Tu to invade the Kingdom of Ji is through a cliff passage which is the last frontier of the Ji Kingdom. Having lost its King and a lot of its troops to a trap laid out by a Great General of Qu Tu, General Mu and his army have been holding off attacks from Qu Tu. Ji governed cities bordering the Qu Tu are in a state of panic as food supplies become scarce, the late Lord of Mu City's sons have a power struggle and crimes are performed in broad day light.Strategies of Sea Observation follows Ji Kuang of the Agriculturist Sect and former Taoist Sect Red Warrior elder Master Ling. Ji Kuang is on a mission to deliver food supplies to a military fort in charge of defending North of the Ji River and happens to meet his vagabond former elder Master Ling on the way. The 3rd faction in Strategies of Sea Observation are the Qi, a small state founded by the evil serpent tribe of Feiyi who practice sorcery. The duo intercept the royal son after preying on women which sparks the attention of the father, the King of Qi to mobilize his army to defeat Ji Kuang and Master Ling as well as seize the Ji governed Fort to the North of Ji River. Things aren't as simple for the King of Qi as he underestimates the powers of Ji Kuang and Master Ling.Story: 6/10The first season felt like a perpetual series of back and forth fighting between the Ji forces from the fort and the Qi forces. It begins with constant wins on the Ji side thanks to the fast behind-the-scenes planning of Ji Kuang and Master Ling but half way through the series the Ji side experiences some losses and it spirals out of control between the Ji and Qi. Strategies of Sea Observation Season 1 felt like a dragged out version of Kingdom; it had some interesting war machines and strategies but most of the time the enemies get caught and released unscathed setting that perpetual back and forth fighting until episode 16. It would have been more interesting to focus on the real opponents the narrator keeps mentioning at least once in Season 1 (Ji kingdom vs Qu Tu kingdom) Apart from that, it had some good entertaining aspects like the crossbow Ji Kuang uses or the boat decoy Master Ling used toward the end.Art & Sound: 7/10For a series 3+ years old, it has some really good CGI art and animation. It beats a lot of series released in 2020 and 2021 which is kind of sad. The studio has only made Strategies of Sea Observation Season 1 and Season 2 which is tough. I can only speculate that this production was a one-off high budget adaptation of the novel so we can't expect any good visuals from the studio.The sound was pretty good, a lot of battle SFX and eery music which suits the theme of the series. The VA sounds similar to many other Chinese donghua maybe voiced by the same people, nonetheless good job on the sound.Character: 7/10I'm conflicted whether it was a good idea for this series to have 2 main characters. The main characters are in a senior/junior comradery relationship which is a surprise since literally every series with 2 male MCs are borderline yaoi especially Chinese donghuas (Scumbag System, Mo Dao Zu Shi etc) Except in this series, it explores 2 people on the opposite end of the spectrum, a determined and respectful Ji Kuang and a lustful and cunning Master Ling. The character conflict with the Ji fort troops and the male MCs are funny sometimes like the arrow scene with Ji Kuang and one of the commanding officers boasting (Episode 5 16:15) The only thing I think this series really lacks is the enemies; Throughout the series the MCs are battling against a Qi King sorcerer who is at deaths door, 2 high ranking commanders who have muscle brains and a seductive simpleminded female sorcerer instead of the rumored talented Qu Tu commanders and armies. It seems like a waste of character establishment to mention the Qu Tu right in the beginning because it's deceiving since Season 1s enemies aren't Qu Tu.Enjoyment & Overall: 7/10This was a lot easier to watch than some cultivation donghua since it didn't follow the same boring tropes generic Chinese wuxia novels/manhua follow using Tournaments, Auctions, Cultivation academies, noble family vs. useless branch family etc. It also had some sense of plot and character progression. The story didn't throw as much random backstory at us. Overall, good watch.";Recommended
0;Edokko Boy: Gatten Tasuke;U-Turn90;https://myanimelist.net/profile/U-Turn90;8;Edokko Boy Gatten Tasuke is a comedic early 90s anime. A manga version with slightly more child friendly humor was also released.In a futuristic version of Edo city (the historical real Edo would eventually become Tokyo), life is a mixture of medieval Japan and science fiction. Peace is protected by the police forces. A group of young police academy trainees are at the center of the story. Most episodes set up a case in the beginning, trouble occurs, and the police academy students must find a way to solve the case.Protagonist Tasuke is a free spirited young boy aiming to become a famous policeman just has his deceased father was. While he has a good heart he is also a bit of a pervert and tends to act before thinking everything through.Tasuke has a pseudo rival in Darth Benkei, a tank-like robot based on Darth Vader and Benkei (a historical warrior monk). High durability but mostly incompetent, always taking the brute force approach.Kintarou (completely unlike the boy of legends) is a fragile and sensitive computer expert and tactical geniusGhengis Khan is a floating helmet shaped transvestite robot (shown through a very girlish way of speaking) that can fuse with other machines.Last and to some point actually least) we have Omoncha, who is best described as a spoiled japanese schoolgirl with… no special abilities at all.Other characters include Tasuke’s robotic dog, a teacher based on buddha firing lighting from his head when in anger, and two adult and actually competent fully trained officers.There is a recurring antagonist on the form of Ratman (a mix of Batman and the Japanese “nezumi kozou” thief of legends), however most episodes have a dedicated new bad guy.Pretty much everything in this anime is based on Japanese history or legends. Language humor and old Japanese words not used in modern conversation are omnipresent, so it can be difficult to understand whats being discussed at times. Other humor is based on slapstick and some juvenile stuff, such as jokes about Tasuke's butt, but generally nothing too fringe.My biggest gripe with the show is how some early episodes can get really slow paced, have boring camera angles and static group conversation scenes. Not really a good fit for a show with such an outrageous setting and cast.Visually it’s a generally a nicely looking anime for its period, although I would have preferred a higher level of detail and more closeups, this was all partially solved in later episodes though. Tasuke’s feet (he’s barefoot all the time) for example are often simplified to the point of looking like flesh colored socks.The opening song is catchy and well done, the ending theme is more serious, perhaps a tad on the melancholious side. Music and Sound effects to support the action on screen are appropriate. Voice acting is well done, no complaints here.At 22 episodes, its short for a show with such a big cast. This is a big minus as the show was getting better and better with each episode. The final episodes thus comes abruptly, ending a show that I felt that had a lot more life in it. There are so many topics the show barely touches on, such as Ghengis Khan transformation ability or Tasuke’s father.The last episode is a nice farewell to the series while keeping the door open for a continuation (which obviously never happened) and leaves no sour aftertaste as it kept the comedic tone of the series instead of trying to shoehorn in an overly dramatic ending. I’ve rewatched the show twice and still enjoyed it very much.Regardless of all criticism, it’s nicely made show that I believe is worth checking out for everyone that can enjoy the old japan/sci-fi setting and wants to explore oldschool anime outside of established and highly popular shows.;Recommended
0;Shin Shounan Bakusouzoku Arakure Knight;Perevodildo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Perevodildo;5;A rather commonplace 90s delinquents/bosozoku anime. Nothing more, nothing less. Pretty lackluster and vapid ova, both compared to OG Shounan Bakusozoku and as a standalone project. While ep1 was still somewhat faithful to the spirit and tried to maintain a straight face, ep2 went places and, well, lived up to the title. The whole OVA is basically one old school biker (that may have or may have not appeared in OG OVA *smirk, smirk*) saving the bacon for the younger seedlings. But well, unlike the OG OVA, this has nothing original to offer and is pretty shallow in general. One gang beat up the other, the other comes back in larger numbers and with said old school bosozoku. Sometimes because of a girl, sometimes out of whim, just cause we're 90s delinquent ova. Rince, sleep, repeat. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯;Mixed Feelings
0;Bug tte Honey;CureMALlard;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CureMALlard;9;"I know you may be asking. ""This show might be pretty bad because it's based off a video game."" Yeah, we know some game adaptations are so bad they're fun to laugh at, like Captain N. Bug-tte Honey may look like another game adaptation that'll be thrown to the wayside but do you wanna know the difference between Captain N and this show? This one has heart.The story is basically like any other fish out of water story, but the thing that makes this simple story so engaging is the adventures Bug-tte Honey, Master Higgins (Takahashi), and the rest of the cast go through. One minor problem I have is that the first half of the show isn't really that engaging, which could make others think it'll be a 13 episode show, heck even I thought so, but once the second half kicks in, I actually started to feel engaged and even enjoying myself all to the end. Take notes DiC, this is how you do a video game based series.It isn't just the story that makes this show worthwhile, art can also be great importance for the viewers to get hooked watching. I gotta say the art looks top notch, but not surprising since it's made by TMS and all. I mean the backgrounds look incredibly stylish, and the 8 bit recreated sequences for episodes are nice to look at, charming even. I have to give props to the crew working on the show to create such a huge world with simple drawing techniques.Art can be effective but sound is at play here too and so far the TMS crew really didn't slack off when it comes to the soundtrack. The opening of the show is catchy and upbeat, the theme when King Dino (Kyura) and his henchmen being present is ominous and even threatening, and the toe tapping tune when action occurs keeps you at the edge of your seat. They may reuse them but it doesn't really matter, they're still fun to listen to and it's no wonder why a CD of the entire show has been made, it's that good.Characters can make or break a story and honestly, the characters for this show made this story to me. There's not a single character at all that I actively dislike or find mediocre as every single character doesn't feel one note upon my first viewing. King Dino in my opinion is my personal favorite because of his pathetic excuse for villainy is fun to watch and his antics with Master Higgins are some of my personal favorite moments. The heroes aren't too shabby either. Dal is innocent enough, Midori and One-Up when they're on screen are just too fun to ignore, and the star, Bug-tte Honey, is such a darling and is a sweetheart to Higgins. The side characters are also fun as well and have great depth for their individual episodes but I won't spoil them for you since you have to watch yourself.My enjoyment of the show was neutral at the beginning. I didn't find the show harmless but the first half looked like something I can watch for a few weeks and get it over with but later on as the plots started to get more wackier and funnier, that's when I knew this will be a show that I'll never forget so easily. If you love a fun adventure series with a lot of comedy, give this show a try and that's why my final rating for this show is a 9/10. Highly recommended.";Recommended
0;Warau Salesman Dai SP-banashi;Wolfgang_B;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wolfgang_B;8;"Although I enjoyed the main series, my main problem with it was that every episode followed the exact same formula, with pretty much no variance in how the story plays out. In contrast, these specials manage to do a much better job telling a unique and interesting story in every episode. I'm sure this is partly due to the longer run time of each episode, but nevertheless the original series could have been much better if it took an approach more similar to what was done in these specials. My only real complaint is that we only got 8 of these specials, compared to the main series' 103 episodes; I would've liked to have gotten more.If you enjoyed the original series, you'll probably like these specials even more. If you didn't enjoy the original series for similar reasons to what I describe above, then perhaps you may find these specials to be more interesting of a watch.";Recommended

0;Pink no Curtain;Muffed;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Muffed;5;"My fellow degenerates,Today I bring you Pink no Curtain.TLDR: This is a fucked up hentai but not due to H scene contentArt: It's not bad for 1987 but there are barely any H scenes and they don't get graphic really at all. One of the guy's dicks legit looks like a fucked up chunk of wood for some artistic reason. Character designs overall are pretty much the old-school generic ones.Sound: VA is decent, the music is actually really nice and OP/ED is better than most others, but doesn't really set the mood or anything. It's just good music. Complaint: Not nearly enough high-pitched moans.Story: This is where it gets fucked. The whole plot is about this brother who wants to fuck his (older?) sister. Normally this is fine for hentai and I was readily awaiting a sex scene as the sister straight up walks around naked in front of her brother (wtf?!) but it NEVER happens. There is NO H scene between them... Sister fucks her teacher because she ""loves"" him and he be like ""nah there's no love we just be fucking"" The brother fucks his friend's ""girlfriend?"" Brother watches his friend as his friend's gf fuck, friend knew he watched, scum sucker tells his gf to fuck his friend so Brother isn't a virgin anymore. They both fuck, and she legit cries after he cums in her, fuck me... Later, after he fucks her again, he leaves, but then Naoko's (friends gf) brother comes in and wrestles her down and proceeds to rape her... As she yells for help and tells him to stop... My face ------> ._. Now, this wasn't hot as it was very fast-paced, and not much is shown but the brother says ""I remember you like it from the back"" and I'm like ""fuck."" Who knows how long he's been raping her from before she decided to live with someone else. No wonder she's fucked up. MC Brother hears/sees what's happening but being the bottom-feeding, shit-slurping, dipshit of a human he is, simply dips and does nothing and calls nobody. Perhaps he thought, ""Wow, I wish I had the balls to rape MY sister""Overall: Not good at all. H scenes are so short and non-graphic it's hard to even whip poor rick throughout the half-hour episode. On top of that, the incest fantasy goes NOWHERE and I have to watch a fucked up girl get raped by people who were supposed to care about her. Strip away everything, and at least the music is good. Only fappable if you're really desperate or can let loose in sub 20 seconds *wink wink*Thank you for reading,With love,Muffed :3";Mixed Feelings
0;Robot Taekwon V;mouthpiece;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mouthpiece;5;"Ah, such fond memories. Taekwon V is one of the first mecha movies I watched as a little kid and I must say I was thrilled with its fast pacing and almost non-stop action. It was the late 80’s, television was full of kid stuff, and dubbed VHS were pouring in from all sides with all sorts of animated stories the videoclubs never bothered to categorize properly.I didn’t know it back then but turns out Taekwon V is actually on of the earliest Korean anime-style rip-offs. The similarities to Mazinger Z are more than obvious (just look at the ship entering the head) but copyrights where blurry back then and nobody cared much about these low budget productions. Plus they never aired Mazinger in my country to even see the similarities and after awhile all classical robot shows copied each other and looked the same so I doubt anyone else cared to make a fuss about it.So what is this movie besides a copycat? Simple, it is fun. Fun in the way that it was made by Koreans, for Koreans, based on a foreign series which was very popular amongst children back then. It is also a stand alone movie instead of a mostly episodic series, thus the development and the revelations were coming one after another in a few minutes. Which is also something that I am not sure about; was the version I watched as a kid really only one hour long? It sure felt a lot longer to me but I was just a silly kid so I may be mistaken. You see when I recently rewatched the film, I learned that the original version was lost forever and they could only find and salvage a very corrupted copy from some warehouse. Being considered a national treasure, the government poured lots of money so they would remake it frame by frame, and thus we have the current remastered version. I know they changed the music and I am sure they redubbed the voices but the footage is basically the same… but felt going much faster. Was it really only one hour long?Anyways, the reason they went to all this trouble to remake it is basically because it was a smash hit in Korea as well as in many other countries it was exported to. The dubbed version I had as a kid didn’t seem to show it that much but turns out it was so successful basically because it was oozing with patriotism. I mean, damn, it is almost considered propaganda the way they glorify Korea in here. First it promotes martial arts and especially Tae kwon do, of which they are very proud of. Then it presents all people from other nations (Japan, India, America, Russia) to be either ugly or stupid. Finally it sets the country where the robot is to be Korea (you clearly see the flags and hear the name) and has the characters drawn in a rather familiar to their animation style way (eyes, lips, hands) to make it feel very keen to their culture.Of course I had never realized all that as a kid and even if I had I am not Korean to give a damn. The reason I liked it so much was simply because it wasn’t fooling around at all. The action and the revelations were non-stop and the movie only lasts one hour (or at least the remastered version does) so kids would not be bored with it. Also, despite being a silly story about robots and martial arts, it had many things going on in it so it didn’t feel simplistic at all. Although the basic scenario is (just like in Mazinger) a mad scientist trying to take over the world with robots and another scientist building his own to stop him, there were also many other side stories going on to flavour it. There was for example a martial arts tournament, where the protagonists competes in Tae Kwon Do. We get some fighting choreography regarding that (crude but it’s there) where sports and fair play and training hard are promoted. It is very motivational and dynamic for kids. Then there is another side story with the daughter of the mad scientist, who is torn between being treated as a cyborg (yes, she is artificial) or as a human being. There is a part where the protagonist tries to cheer her and his platonic girlfriend gets mad and offends her, thus turns her to the dark side. As a cyborg, she also fights with a fencing sword (more sports) that shoots electricity. Then there is the good scientist who is a pacifist and who has these notions of fighting only for protecting. Then there is a sub plot where the villains kidnap athletes who lost in their championships because it would be far easier to lure losers into working for them for glory and revenge. And there are actually twists to all the above. Crude and rushed but they are there. You simply can’t ignore the rich context.Let’s suppose you don’t like the context (shame on you). The action part is also very good for its time. Based on various martial arts and classic robot attacks, there is a great variety in how the characters fight. Punching, slashing, burning, crushing, stomping, you name it, verbal psychological warfare; even pepper spray is used! You get martial artists, gunners, cyborgs, tanks, airplanes, giant robots, and teapot comic reliefs. There is even variety in backgrounds; you get arenas, cities, deserts, pyramids, Chinese dragons up in the skies; man this is a blast.And let me clarify that as cool as all the above sound, the production values are poor, even for the time the movie was made. You can find continuity errors, repeated footage, crude motions, unimpressive voice acting, and the like. If you are to be bitches about it and judge the movie based on all that, then you will hate it with all you got. It doesn’t look nice at all, ok?

1;Robot Taekwon V;polybiusdrop;https://myanimelist.net/profile/polybiusdrop;6;"Disclaimer: This is a review of what I could find of the western adaptation of ""Robot Teakwon V"", Voltar the Invincible. which seems to be edited down and possibly incomplete, seeing as is under and hour and ends almost mid-sentence, though it does tell a complete story. There might be a spoiler though spoiler is an ambiguous term so its not my fault, nothing is.Story: Billy Future is a karate champ who's dad is a robot scientist, and when the worlds put in danger by a former mad scientist colleague of his father, Billy pilots Voltar to stop the mad scientist robot destruction. The story is as basic and typical as it gets and often stuff would just happen because why not. The only sorta notable part of the thing is Wondera's side story. Though its barely there and its also very stock ,to say anything more would spoil what little there is to Voltar the Invincible overall.Art: A product of the time though even by 1974 it might have seemed dated, looking much like 1960s tv quality anime, Hanna Barbara or maybe even some of the old Fleischer Superman cartoons if famous studios had less money to worth with. So production values aren't high with this anime but theres still charm in the art style and animation. I like the crudeness in the rotoscoping or how Voltar moves while doing tkd along with the old style animation effects assuming you've seen the mentioned cartoons or the like.Sound: The dub is good, it gets the job done. Its none of that terrible ""anime"" voice acting common in later dubs from the 2000s. The music has all been redone to fit in with the dubs 1985 release. So its mostly cheap syth and early electronica... but its pretty good actually, though there isnt much of it and it does get repetitive. It leaves the anime feeling like its proto-AdultSwim or Cartoon Network, back when they'd rework old cartoons with new sound.Character: Hmm, does this anime have character? Yes, the anime it has plenty of character especially with the dub and cheesy then modern music... Though I guess I should explain the characters too. Characters, there isn't much to say as I don't think anyone has any character outside of a few. Wondera is hot, and then there was tommy, a boy who wears a tea pot on his head. Though he plays the typical kid pretend sidekick roll in these sorts of hero stories I suppose his design is neat as you could easily forget hes a human. Theres also Dr Manlee, who has a great a name and for no reason is also a tkd master. Everyone else much like the story are as stock as they come, I'd say even the notable characters are really typical filler.Enjoyment: This is hard to explain because Voltar is enjoyable for a while, its almost in that so bad its good kind of enjoyable, except without and of the awkward, embarrassing, and cringe humor that usually comes with the so bad its good... genre. Like, it has lackluster animation music , along with its editing gives the anime this almost homemade feel. Its also kinda extreme with (and well appreciated)quick deaths, karate chops that explode robots, Wondera's everything. The voice acting is nostalgic somehow despite not having grown up in the 80s or watching old cartoons. Sadly and surprisingly ... Voltar the Invincible is not perfect. Honestly the novelty of it all wears off and the anime feels like exercise to finish. You'll find your self skipping through the final parts just to get it over with. It really doesn't do a good job keeping the viewer interested after all its cards are all the table.Overall: Its a novelty and can be enjoyable it if, and pardon my language, the viewer isn't weeb.";Mixed Feelings
0;Robot Taekwon V;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;3;"In the world of animation, there's the concept of the ""Terribad"" anime. That is, an anime show or series that is *so* bad, that it's actually entertaining to watch. The mere act of making fun of it while watching it provides enjoyment. (It's the same principle that drives shows like MST3K)First off, let's not forget that this movie is culturally very important, as one of the earliest popular Korean animated movies that went on to become a widely loved hit within the country with many sequels. We can recognize and honor that history, while at the same time being critical of the story and animation. After all, we aren't grading on a curve here.It's straight-up a children's robot story, very similar to the countless other giant robot stories that were flooding Japan during the 1970's. It's awfully derivative, as the brilliant young taekwondo superstar son of a brilliant scientist is the only person in the country able to pilot an experimental giant robot to defeat the evil menace (""Red Star"", guess what that represents) and save the entire nation. In fact, the creator very freely admits on lifting concepts whole cloth from the likes of Mazinger Z.The story is laughably simple, and a jumbled mess. The artwork is uninspiring. The animation is even less inspiring than that. In fact, much of the type of characters and plot, the animation techniques are of the same level that Japan was trying out up to a full decade earlier. Despite its proud history, it must be said this is a very amateur quality work.Even so, if you have a bunch of buddies that want to sit around and point and laugh at something on the television, this definitely fits the bill. All in good humor, of course.";Not Recommended
0;Mukidashi no Mitsuko;afoxii;https://myanimelist.net/profile/afoxii;7;-Disclaimer-First of all, as a non-native English speaker, I don’t guarantee my writing accuracy in this review, and I early apologize for the mistakes you might find in it.One thing I like with MAL is the anime ranking. We can browse and search for the anime with the worst grades ever. And that’s how I discovered Mukidashi no Mitsuko. When I saw the picture, I was so amused, and I decided to watch it. This ONA isn’t long so it’s quick to watch, and we can find it on the creator’s YouTube channel! There were no reviews on Mukidashi no Mitsuko’s MAL page, so I decided to write mine.STORY: 7/10Since Mukidashi no Mitsuko is a very short film, the story is quite simple. However, I found it poetic and the nonsense of the situations made the whole short film really funny. I was truly surprised, because I wasn’t expecting anything from a 6-minute long short ONA with a bad score on MAL, but in the end, I laughed several times! That’s why I’ll put a 7.ART: 7/10Mukidashi no Mitsuko has an uncommon drawing style, which I really appreciated. We can feel Taniguchi’s (the director) touch. I must still admit that the animation wasn’t very successful, but I know that the director works independently and does not have a high budget for his projects. I think 7 is a good score for the art.SOUND: 7/10As I said before, Taniguchi works alone, which explains why he did all the sound effects himself. Some will find this disturbing, but I found it hilarious! Regarding the song, I thought it was funny. In fact, the assumed cheapness of the whole anime makes it very comic. It’s one of the features that made me enjoy Mukidashi no Mitsuko. I believe the sound deserves a 7.CHARACTER: 6/10The characters are introduced in a fine way. In six minutes, you obviously can’t develop them but I didn’t think it was especially a problem. The main character is a bit cliché, he’s the caricature of the exhausted workers in Japanese society. On the other hand, we have a sort of mysterious winged angel. So the characters are funny, some are original, but I wouldn’t say they’re fabulous either. 6 seems a fair score to me.OVERALL: 7/10Mukidashi no Mitsuko was good. The nonsense and the ‘handmade’ style made it really enjoyable, as well as this song. I recommend it to you if you’re into weird and alternative ONAs and independent productions.;Recommended
1;Mukidashi no Mitsuko;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;7;This is another philosophical satire by Takashi Taniguchi that's a bit more abstract than his other works. Mitsuko is a chubby man or woman that presumably does lazy work and has no other ambition. It's hard to tell what actually transpires throughout the 6-7 minutes of this show, since Mitsuko spends it daydreaming and pondering existential questions. You could either interpret the events as canon, in which time passes faster in an isekai, or that Mitsuko distracted herself long enough to get old. So whether it's Christopher Nolan's Interstellar or Pink Floyd's Time is up to you, but regardless it's a lot to pack into a short comedy about doing marijuana, cocaine, and LSD.;Recommended

0;Je Bul Chal-ssi Iyagi;Stephen2D;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stephen2D;7;"""The story of Mr. Sorry"" begins on a strange note with a bizarre game show in which the audience and the viewers are supposed to vote and provide a Guilty or Not Guilty verdict... on a suspect spider in a glass box. This trial looks like any modern day reality show even with two containers named ""To Kill or Not To Kill"". With this premise settled it is very hard to not see the black comedy, but then, using flashbacks we find the life of Mr. Sorry, a timid man working for an ear cleaning company to collect the funds necessary to find his beloved older sister, who has gone missing.The plot mentioned before works in conformity with the titular character, offering him an easy to understand objective and a bit of characterization. We could say the character almost does not matter, but his interaction with others soon starts to reveal more intrigue. His life seems pretty bland until a science experiment was conducted on him without his knowledge by the company where he works. Long story short, he shrinks so much that he is able to reach every crevice of the client's ear due to his size. The interesting thing that happens is soon Sorry finds that he can gain access to people’s unconscious, this incident determining the appearance of some surrealistic scenes.More important is that this is the beginning of some social commentary, the minds of people like cosmopolitan socialites, politicians, bodybuilders, businessmen reveal darker aspects of human desire. Even if it can be a little bit cliché, the movie satirizes these characters but also reveals personal aspects of Mr. Sorry. A journey of self-discovery can reveal also the dark side of one's personality.With a little over an hour runtime, the anime sometimes might seem poorly paced and even if the characters are very simple in their desires you want more from them. Even Mr. Sorry, in the end, seems like a lost cause who achieved nothing but being a guide in a different world. It might seem appropriate, one description of the movie that I liked being ""it’s sort of a Kafka's <<Metamorphosis>>, Korean version"". The movie is well put together considering the fact that five Korean directors made it. If you can get over the rough animation and some intentionally ugly character designs, you can discover ""an uneven unique, sensory experiment which won't be to everyone's taste"".";Recommended

0;Shiratori Reiko de Gozaimasu!;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;"“Shiratori Reiko de Gozaimasu!” is a 1-episode shoujo romance OVA that has a standard premise and decent production values. The manga it’s based on has even inspired 3 live-action TV shows and 2 movies, so there must be something good about the story. However, ultimately the unlikable characters and lack of runtime to establish key elements make the anime version unpleasant to watch.The story follows Reiko Shiratori, a young woman whose crush, Tetsuya, confessed to her back in high school. She turned him down due to peer pressure, but she actually likes him, and decides to follow him after graduation, enrolling in the university he attends and renting an apartment across from his. She still can’t admit her feelings for him, though, so every time she gets close to him, she ends up acting all haughty and mean and basically sabotaging herself. She finds out that her friend Kyoko, who back in high school had discouraged her from dating Tetsuya, is also at the same university, and her presence complicates matters. Will Reiko eventually be able to openly admit her feelings for Tetsuya?The way this anime treats romantic relationships could be considered toxic and distorted. Characters sleeping around with people they don’t like is presented as normal and just a way to “vent out pent-up feelings” or “fulfill one’s feelings of lust,” and the characters handle this in a contradictory way. In one instance, you’ll see a character telling another character that doing such things is wrong (with a slap in the face for good effect), but then later see the same character attempting to do the very same thing themselves. The characters all act unrealistically to events that occur, and their interactions with each other feel sterile. Also, it’s difficult to sympathize with any of them. Since Reiko is the heroine, we’re supposed to root for her, but she comes across as being selfish, rude and immature. Tetsuya is dense and doesn’t have much of a personality. The other characters don’t stand out, either.Since this anime is only one episode, there’s not enough time to establish the characters’ backgrounds or relationships with each other, which adds to the superficiality of the whole thing. And although it ends on a satisfying note, the ending itself is cheesy and rather difficult to believe.The technical aspects are fairly decent. The animation is fluid, although the art is not that detailed. The character designs are not appealing, however. This could be more of an issue with the designs in the original manga than the anime, but the characters all have large, pointy noses and chins. Also, their torsos are puffy, and they look like they’re wearing shoulder pads. With designs like these, it’s difficult to believe that Reiko is as beautiful as the other characters seem to think she is.The music is good; all of the songs are composed by Hitomi Kuroishi, so they’ve got a catchy, nostalgia-filled feeling to them. The voice acting is average.There’s not much objectionable content in the visuals — just an implied sex scene (nothing graphic), a love hotel scene, and a scene of a man taking a shower (from behind). The real objectionable content is more in how the characters react to the idea of sleeping around, etc. as mentioned earlier.Overall, there wasn’t a lot to like about “Shiratori Reiko de Gozaimasu!” except for perhaps the music. The characters are just too obnoxious, and the relationships don’t feel organic at all. Also, there’s currently no English version available, so I would not recommend watching this.";Not Recommended

0;Obake Zukan;Wallanimx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wallanimx;4;I'm rating this from the perspective as a 29 y/o woman, as well as giving it a fair review if I were to watch this as a child as well.The show is about a child being confronted with various fears (the dark, hospitals, school, etc) and having supernatural buddies help him realize how its not so scary. The buddies are a hat and a cell phone. The cattish hat is able to talk him through the various ordeals while the phone analyzes the creature/problem itself.They help this elementary aged child into confronting and defeating these fears one by one, teaching him that everything has a solution. And that often these fears are nothing to be afraid of once confronted.You do have the weird supernatural creatures, but for the most part they are harmless. This is a kid's show afterall.For me, this show was incredibly boring despite it only being 3 minutes an episode. I thought this series would end at 12eps initially but it lasted 39, so it is what it is. For an adult we've already faced all these fears and so its just a boring kid's show.But that's it, its a KIDS SHOW. So it wasn't made for me. For a younger child within the ages of 2-7 I can see this being a fun short between cartoons every week. Its not scary, its colorful, and it teaches you how to confront a different fear the child may have every week.For a child I definitely recommend this. For the rest of us, its just not made for us.Its a solid 7 for any child. But I have to give it a 4. <3;Not Recommended
0;Bing Zhu Qi Hun;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;7;"The Soul of Soldier Master has the potential to be one of the donghua greats, but hasn't really picked up traction, perhaps due to the confusing first couple of episodes that don't seem to match up to its synopsis. That's because the synopsis, which is characteristically introduced by a narrator at the beginning of the first episode, gets way ahead of the first season. Rather, the pacing of Soldier Master is sort of like another donghua Island of Siliang, slow and methodological, introducing all of the characters while peeling back layers of the plot like an onion, until the whole situation is simmering and ready to explode. Like Island of Siliang, this show ends with a massive cliffhanger at the end of season 1, with a teaser for the next season.The plot of the season could be more accurately described as follows. Linhai is a town where the soldier masters (""bing zhu""), cultured humanoid animals, live peacefully side by side with humans. It's in a distant corner of the continent, not very highly regarded by the powerful cultivation families. One master of a demon sect hatches a plan using a technique several hundred years in the making, researched over generations of his own tribe to steal civilians' soul powers en masse. Since soul powers between the differing demon sects would conflict, he decides to use the technique on the soldier masters in Linhai, since it would be far enough off the map to avoid attracting attention from any powerful clans.The protagonist Li Shi (nickname Shi Tou -- ""tou"" means head, and the entire phrase ""shi tou"" means rock or stone, which could be an endearing or mild term for calling someone slightly dumb) must catch a legendary Seven-Colored Fish in order to receive a ticket to enter a martial arts competition through the backdoor. Meanwhile, mercenaries accompany a humanoid shark felon to Linhai, supposedly to turn him in, but the shark breaks loose. A woman steals medicine from a Taoist to cure a mysterious man in the woods. And a humanoid armadillo could be seen pacing the countryside. Of course, all of these plot threads are related.Perhaps like Island of Siliang, all of the main characters are oblivious to what's about to happen, and the main conflict is set up to be bigger than it seems that any one of them could handle. Li Shi, who has always disliked the wealthy, is teasing his competition and getting into petty squabbles with various characters, much to the embarrassment of the judges, but providing comedic relief. Thus, the show depicts an ominous juxtaposition between a devilish plan of which its genocidal results could be seen in a dream in the first episode, and the protagonists still having their fun. It's just building tension using this contrast. Episode by episode, the plan is revealed a bit more, and some of the side characters figure out what's going on, but most of the town is still in the lighthearted mood provided by the entertainment of the competition. The town mayor, not wanting to lose face with the judges, brushes all the problems under the rug.The execution can be slow, and it could be a bit annoying how unaware the main characters are of the mess they're in -- but it's interesting. I want to see what comes next. When a major plot point does develop, it feels like everything that went into it was not wasted, and all the carefree scenes somehow played a role. When fights occur, they are well directed, and still reveal a little bit of the mystery. Despite many scenes seemingly unrelated to the main plot, it all somehow gets there, but with more world building and character development. The interaction between the characters and the townsfolk of Linhai, as well as the occasional outsider, builds a fuller picture of the whole dynamic. It gives personality to the town and lets us know what's at stake.Season 1 seems like it's just the prologue, so we won't really know how the meat of the conflict would develop until later seasons. But given how purposeful it's been developed and directed so far, I have high hopes. I might not live out its potential, but potential it has.";Recommended

Comedy needs to be added as a genre to this short film.While poor animation and below standard character designs are usually negatives, it only helps to accentuate the silliness of this short. Even if this was likely targeted towards children, the mature can still find brief entertainment in a classic cat and mouse chase with a hilariously predictable outcome.;Recommended
0;Jing: Shuang Cheng 2nd Season;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;8;"Mirror: Twin Cities seems to have slipped under the radar, even to donghua fans, and that's probably because the distributor hasn't released it for free online internationally. The result of that is that it's a bit hard to find a consistent source for subs, although if you understand Chinese, your options are a bit more. That's too bad, because it's a cinematic tour de force, hosted as ultra widescreen on YouTube (uploaded by fans), with a haunting orchestral soundtrack ever present in the background.The protagonist is Na Sheng, a little girl perhaps in the Miao ethnic minority that has her whole town slaughtered in war, so she ventures out to Yun Huang, a place passed down through legends as some kind of paradise, figuring she has nowhere else to exist. On the way there, she meets Su Mo, a puppeteer with a complicated history. It turns out that Yun Huang has fallen from its reputation due to a conflict between 3 races.A millennium ago, the Kong Sang race were the first to live there, and they constructed a tower that reached to the heavens. Besotted with power, the king at the time enslaved their ally race that helped them rise to dominance, a race of mermen that came out from the sea called the Jiao people. When the Jiao cry, their tears harden into gemstones that are worth a lot of money. Then later, a warmongering people called the Ice Tribe slaughtered the civilians, forcing the Kong Sang out from their ivory tower, sacrificing themselves to become mere ghosts to activate a formation to fend off the intruders. Now, the Kong Sang royalty, who are harmed by sunlight due to the sacrifice, live in a shadow city underneath the lake, a mirror reflection of the city above it. The Jiao people, enslaved by both sides, has become merchants, running a gambling and prostitution den to hang on to power, waiting for their legendary savior. And the Ice Tribe has control of the tower.In the distant past, Su Mo had blinded himself to prevent the Kong Sang from getting his tears. Then his captors offered him a chance to life: that he becomes a temporary friend to the Kong Sang princess, Bai Ying, who's fated to be locked up in the tower until her marriage. They become each other's best and only friends, but it couldn't last.What follows is a haunting tale of romance, tragedy, war and redemption, with a gripping backstory and characters who must come to terms with their past, while fighting a war in the present. Within such a short season, there's plenty of world building, including the customs and legends of each race. The themes deal with racism, slavery, and overcoming hatred. The place Na Sheng and Su Mo end up in is a far cry from paradise; she had escaped one hell only to end up in another one. As an outsider, she is distrusted and tossed around by the forces, but will she find what she's looking for?The first ""season"" is an extended cinematic intro of noticeably higher production value. The next 2 episodes (in season 2) are condensed, more linear version of what happened in the first season, and the remaining 16 episodes sets us up for the main arch. Unfortunately, we'll have to wait at least a year to get season 3.This show should not be slept on! I ended hating some of these characters and feeling sorry for others, but the touching drama inevitably pulls me in and makes me invested. The grandiosity and epicness of it all is one of the reasons I've come to love donghua. Unlike many anime shows, the characters here are not angsty because they're victims of bullying or domestic disputes (not to make light of those problems), they're war orphans. And I know movies like Grave of the Fireflies are crushing as well, but as far as shows go, donghua worlds are much more unforgiving, and actions have consequences. It won't be like My Hero Academia where epic fights happen and then somehow civilian casualties are glossed over. Collateral damage is very central to these characters' worries. If genocide makes you squirm, be warned.";Recommended
1;Jing: Shuang Cheng 2nd Season;nessawvera;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nessawvera;7;Loved it. I'm not sure if they're ever going to release a Season 3 seeing as how the story just started to unfold, and I don't know if anyone realizes that there's a C-Drama adaptation of this story. But if the ending of Bai Ying and Su Mo's love story is exactly as how it's told in the drama, despite the mermen having their wish fulfilled after a long battle, well...I guess I'm quite happy to just leave it at where it is now. The fight scenes were awesome and Ah Nuo (Su Mo's puppet) was creepy AF. Does anyone else thinks he looks a bit like Chucky?! And while I found everything confusing at first, it gets better once the characters' background story is revealed and you understand what the hell is going on, though the pacing could have used some serious work. It's like freaking Star Wars and everything's in reverse before you get to the WHY IT HAPPENED.I would tag this as an inspirational-melodrama-wuxia-romance.;Recommended
0;Tongari Boushi no Memole: Marielle no Housekibako;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"This OVA is a compilation of a few episodes of the ""Tongari Boushi no Memole"" TV series, along with a 5-minute original short done by the art director and animation director. By the way, there is also a 15-minute ""Tongari Boushi no Memole"" compilation movie, but that doesn't appear to be in MAL's database.Anyway, as this is a compilation, scenes from mainly 4 episodes are stitched together, with the character Marielle narrating to smooth over the scene transitions. Some of the scene transitions appear choppy and the plot can be hard to follow if you aren't familiar with the series already. For example, there was a character who got introduced in one scene, and in the next scene he's shown as being friends with Marielle, Memoru and the rest. It was a bit too jarring and sudden. Due to this, it would probably be best to treat this as a recap instead of as a standalone movie.I managed to figure out most of what was going on despite having never seen the TV series, but it was a bit hard to follow, and there was no linearly progressing plot. It really did just feel like the highlights of 4 episodes put together, and didn't have much of an ending (or really a beginning or middle, for that matter). It was just a series of misadventures centered on Marielle and Memoru.As for the characters, Marielle is a sickly rich girl who lives in the middle of nowhere. She has a mean governess who has something against owls, and there are a couple of other workers who live in the house. Memoru is an alien who looks like a little gnome or fairy. She and her friends' spaceship crashed on Earth, and I guess they must have given up on returning to their home planet, because they made themselves a little village and talk with the local wildlife and everything. Marielle eventually gets well enough to go to a boarding school, where most of her classmates are stuck-up bullies, but she does meet a guy she likes named Oscar, who becomes her friend and (apparently at some point) befriends the aliens. There isn't much character development, and it's hard to sympathize with any of the characters, probably because we just don't get to know them very well.The character design is all right for the aliens, but the humans either look generic or sullen-eyed. Marielle looks depressed a lot of the time. One of her ""friends"" has ridiculously long poofy hair. Animation is OK; nothing particularly positive or negative stands out about it. Same for the music/soundtrack. The high-pitched voices of some of the characters can be a little grating.After the credits, there is an original 5-minute animation about Memole done by some of the people who worked on Angel's Egg. It's a bit trippy/dreamy, there's very little dialogue and there's no plot to it. It's kind of interesting as an art piece, but it's not really worth watching this whole OVA just for that.All in all, while this is somewhat watchable, I would recommend skipping it unless you are familiar with the TV series. It doesn't work well as a standalone OVA and, other than the animation at the end, it doesn't have any particular unique or redeeming qualities that would merit watching it otherwise.";Mixed Feelings
0;Mikan-Seijin;Richard-Pham;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Richard-Pham;2;I was looking around for old, obscure shows when I saw a thumbnail of what appeared to be the Annoying Orange’s Japanese ancestor. It caught my eye because his/her/their/[insert neopronoun here] smile taunted me.Now, Extraterrestrial Oranges/Mikan-Seijin is a short anime with twenty-six episodes spanning twenty-two seconds or less. You can literally finish it within twenty minutes via a YouTube playlist. Unfortunately, it’s an assorted batch of shoddily made gags. Humor is subjective, but I didn’t laugh, grin, or even exhale air out of my nose. Just imagine sitting through an unfunny TikTok compilation. Maybe you kinda get what they’re trying to do in the dozens of seconds your brain is stimulated, but it’s not entertaining and rather boring. How it resembles a tween’s first time making a Flash animation with stolen MapleStory assets doesn’t help either.Each episode is basically like the clip you see after a show returns from a commercial break during the halfway point. They typically end with a burly lad v-clipping into frame as a masculine voice shouts ‘Aniki,’ or ‘brother.’ I, too, shouted out my brother’s name because I needed medical attention for the blood coming out of my ears due to the incessant screeching giggles of those fruity fucks. There’s no dialogue though, if you discount the guy yelling and some background music of a woman singing. These unnamed sour-sweet ballsacks walk around the screen in plenty of places doing plenty of things, but they never stick with me or make me feel satisfied for the handful of seconds I went through to consume. My reaction for the majority of them was more or less, ‘Oh, okay.’Sometimes there’s an onion character, monkey, or multiple muscular men involved. Expectedly, there is no memorable feature that makes anyone stand out in the fleeting runtime. There’s no suspectable main character among the gang of oranges. I occasionally see the enigmatic smile and bushy eyebrows of an anthropomorphic orange on my ceiling, so I presume he is the head honcho haunting my midnight delirium.The only way to salvage this show is to use its quick-paced routine and smash zoomer humor into it. These easily digestible clips are ideal for retaining my minuscule attention span, but the content is not worth sitting through each episode.Nothing of substance was gained or lost with this show, so I found it an apathetic two. I’m not sure how twenty-one people discovered this show, completed it, and gave it a ten out of ten. It’s a wonderful world. When people complain about how modern anime sucks and that older shows had more soul, there is probably only one weirdo who points to this niche series from 1992. Watch it or don’t—it’s repetitively horrible.;Not Recommended
0;Shiritsutantei: Toki Shouzou Trouble Note - Hard & Loose;delta5;https://myanimelist.net/profile/delta5;4;This is a manly anime about a very masculine private detective who likes boxing, women, drinking, betting on the ponies, and other things that make a man a real man. Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous. If you want to watch a somewhat entertaining Japanese anime take on old American hardboiled detective stories then please feel free to check this out. It's lacking in story quality and the animation is...rudimentary...but they do get the atmosphere right. It's a decent adventure through late night bars, shady meetings with sketchy clients, some solid male bonding accomplished through violence, and a bit of casual sex on the side. As long as you're not expecting a satisfying conclusion to the story and just want to be distracted for 45 minutes then this is just fine. But I really can't say it actually deserves a decent score given the overall cheap feel of the production and lack of interest in coming up with a decent script.;Not Recommended

The whole story begins in the future, where people doesn't know what is love anymore, main couple like I said they are not brothers, both come from the future but they don't know/remember that until later in the story, and it has a lot of action with magicThe only good thing of the animation is the music that is really good!

0;Tai Yi Xian Mo Lu: Ling Fei Ji;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;6;"After the first season, I wrote a review about Rise to Immortality having shallow and wordy characters but a good plot, and my criticisms are still mostly true after finishing season 3. But there are certain changes in the upcoming seasons that make me feel like I should give the review an update. Due to the dearth of information about this show, I fear that if I merely write season 2 or season 3 reviews, nobody would see them.Leng Shuang Ning is the most promising disciple of the deity-level Qing Chen Sect. Lacking confidence in her talent, she promises her teacher that she would always stay by his side. To her surprise, she was admonished; her teacher isn't looking for a guard, but a replacement. She is banished from sect grounds to find a fated person and fight demons, if necessary. (In this world, there are xuan (mysterious) sects, mo (demon) sects, and other sects, representing good, evil and neutral.)The first season mainly focuses on the protagonist exploring the mortal realm and grasping the overall situation, introducing a number of characters of different sects whose paths all happen to intersect on a martial arts tournament. Except unlike other such shows with a tournament, the tournament never happens, but is instead the backdrop for a whodunit-type mystery preceding a catastrophe. And while that was a bit of a spoiler, it's the least I could say to convey that the tone of the first season does not really reflect the material after it.This show is dark. The entirety of the second season is sort of a calm before the storm ordeal, like the second seasons of One Punch Man or Mob Psycho 100, where the characters have to find their own way in darkness before discovering light, only here it's both figurative and literal. Although for most of the first season, there isn't very much urgency, allowing the characters to wander about and meander, bumping into each other along the way, and having pretentious sounding conversations about their philosophies with complex Chinese vocabulary (which might also be the reason why there are no good subtitles for this work, since no one could disentangle that mess). In season 2, the characters have all separated and desperately need to find each other.Whether you could enjoy this plot structure depends on how forgiving you are toward questionable character decisions. Rise to Immortality include some of the most frustrating plot mechanics to me, sort of like protecting useless NPCs in an RPG. Characters would at some point rush into battles they couldn't possibly win, kill the enemies right before they start to explain something important, or have to protect weak sidekicks that for some reason have no environmental awareness. These people would try to defend attacks or leave safe spaces to explore despite being told to stay put, and there are always disastrous consequences. In a moment of insanity, one of the characters ""accidentally"" revives a demon overlord.Despite the annoying and contrived devices, I do have to applaud that the show has managed to create a disorganized, claustrophobic atmosphere, where the protagonists are all lost as lambs in the face overwhelming adversity. Part of that is due to their own stupidity, sure, but there is also a well constructed plot brewing in the background. And conspiracies that throw all our assumptions into question.Season 3 features some huge twists, which I won't spoil, and also gives one of the best takes on the human versus demon struggle in these kinds of shows. The one-dimensional stubbornness of the characters in the first season gets challenged, and they are forced to reckon with the reality that the only way they would survive is to be more open-minded about accepting help from the other side. And as the morality of the two sides start to muddle, we're left wondering who the good guys are to begin with.Rise to Immortality is definitely all plot, and while the characters eventually are forced to contend with the events and show some ability to adapt, their development sort of lag. Yes, there are some touching character moments later on, but for the most part, I never found myself defending or empathizing with any character, good or bad (except for some characters introduced later on). But the way the plot develops with just enough of a carrot, but without giving too much away, keeps it interesting. There is always something you won't know, yet it never feels overwhelming. I know what's going on, and what might happen next, but not what might happen after that. The complete breakdown in the second season disrupts all rhythm in the first.It is true that the first season was very conventional, with shallow protagonists more interested in testing each others' strengths like a bunch of teenagers with testosterone issues, while the antagonists all seemed like petty womanizers. It seemed like it was going to proceed down that path to mediocrity. I'm happy to report this was not the case, that the characters that survive are no longer one-dimensional, although they're still not quite at where I'd like them to be.There is still an annoying cat mascot that loves to hear itself speak. The fights are better choreographed than some newer shows, though nothing amazing. I mean there's basic choreography, and not just balls of light or spectral swords or martial spirits running into each other like a bull fight, like the stereotypical shounen fist bump.Watch this if you like somewhat of a deconstruction of the good versus evil cliche. It's not unprecedented, but still a decent watch.";Mixed Feelings

0;Shin Kyojin no Hoshi II;ooReiko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ooReiko;10;"After the detour from the original series themes in ""Shin Kyojin no Hoshi"", this sequel brings the series back to its roots for a perfect conclusion for the whole series.The long awaited continuation of the father and son relationship reaches finally its conclusion through brilliantly presented climax where the whole saga reaches its culmination point. That climax you could say brings definition to the whole series. In addition of that also the relationship to the sport and the people around him are brought to a brilliant conclusion through another set of events culminating to the series of events leading to the final conclusion.To be honest I didnt think it was possible to bring this series such a perfect conclusion considering how many different aspects and themes there were presented in the series and how the first season of ""Shin Kyojin no Hoshi"" seemed to ignore most of these themes and relationships.However I was blown away by the spectacle that was the ending and the conclusion of these themes and how they were presented in this finale. Another impressive factor here is that the passage of time and growing up is also brought into the mix that essentially is one of the keys when it comes to the final conclusion of the series. The history and what has happened throughout the series is reflected against the ""time"" and what ""youth"" means. With this addition the themes that weer originbally brought up in the original series are able to strike you even more impactful fashion when compared to the original presentation in the origianl series.In short this finale makes the whole series look and feel better and more meaningful, even the first season of ""Shin Kyojin no Hoshi"" that I personally dont consider to be up to par with ""Kyojin no Hoshi"" and "" Shin Kyojin no Hoshi II""Overall I'd say that this series presents one of the most complete and satisfying endings to a series that I've ever seen, rivaling series like ""Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu"" and ""Ashita no Joe"" with its scale and the multitude of themes explorted throughout the series.";Recommended
0;Magical Hat;Shura-shurato;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shura-shurato;8;Magical hatto!!! at my age this is as far i can go with kids anime but then again, it was a load of fun and maybe it was not as notable at the time like the Mashin eizan wataru serie's ( 1988-1993) or the dragon quest serie's ( 1989-1992) wich had a lot of funny elements in it , magical hatto was something to watch with the whole familly.To me at first it looked kinda awkward and pinkcheesy as hell, but if u look past the fillers and some of the sing-a longs segments it give's a good laugh with some memorable moments.The story itself is not too complicated, more or less been inspired by other kidslike anime but a Hat than can transform anything out of a hat by saying ...: Magical hatto karukaru shiba something ..... well and some of the most redicilous and over the top ( from a kids point of view) items gets summoned or transformed, fun fun fun.The animation itself looks ok but could be a bit better, not the animation backgrounds itself but some segments looked kinda cheaper and duller , then again there is a great job with some visual effects for its time, funny looking animallike creatures and kidfriendly monsters.Musicwise the sound in my ears sounded like a very cheap early 80's cave recordings, especially the singing sounded mediocre as well the opening intro.I asked myself when the serie's ended about the parents of hat, u see them in the begiinning , something happens and u never see them again , not even in the end. The rest of the casting was quite good,even the villians and henchmen gave me a good laugh out though magical hatto is the main persona , with one grampa wich could be seen'as a sort of 'loremaster of devildom' a doglike boy wich has been introduced from the 1st episode and an adventrous but treasure greedy girl, an talking magical egg and some half robotic animals captured by Hat.I mostly enjoyed it when the villians henchmen try numerous times to get the Magical hat, but when they finally got it they got outwitted in someway that is sooo damn funny, and when peace finally comes to the land a bloody musquito fucks the whole peace treaty up! din't saw that one coming.Overall an 8 based on the positive content and prob what little kids back then assumed as an after day school t.v program , even though sound prod. and art droppings gave it a several dents;Recommended
0;Ippon Bouchou Mantarou;1cY;https://myanimelist.net/profile/1cY;9;"Some people might wonder where lies the value of watching very obscure shows. They're hard to find, hard to know anything about prior to watching them, and rarely serve as a discussion point among peers. What's the point of doing that?Well, sometimes you end up finding a gem hidden in the rough; and I'd definitely consider this to be one of said gems.Ippon Bouchou Mantarou is a show about cooking. No, not Shokugeki no Souma ""food orgasm"" cooking, not Pan de Peace ""moeblobs talk about nothing"" cooking, actual cooking. And there is genuine exhilaration in the ideas it brings and the way it structures the competitions that our main lead, Mantarou, enters.The attention to detail, especially for an OVA from 1991, is very impressive. The show takes the time to walk you through different cuisines, the details behind making them, and sometimes even their origins. However, don't mistake this for the show having slow pacing; it doesn't. The show strikes a balance between anticipation and action, especially in the first episode. The art, though aged by today's standards, looks very good for its time.Ippon Bouchou Mantarou is one of those rare forgotten obscures that holds formidable merit and remains watchable even today. If an old anime about cooking competitions interests you at all, I implore you to give this a try. If you end up liking it, perhaps introduce it to a friend as a conversational topic, because like an old family recipe or an excellent hole-in-the-wall restaurant, a genuinely good obscure anime like this is worth sharing.";Recommended

0;Goldfish Fetish;Stephen2D;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stephen2D;6;Helmut Herbst, a director talks about this experimental movie and explains some of its techniques in this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EliFauneu_E], the prominent influence being of Tanaami's childhood war episode in which he did see flashes of light reflected in his grandmother's fish tank. He was watching from his underground shelter and the goldfish in the tank reflected the bright light of flames and the orange light of the sky lit by bombs.Really poetic considering the times but the work doesn't really capture the essence of war, especially in this era, but on the other hand, translating this work as psychedelic nonsense is also showing a lack of skill. Looking at the artist's life we could say it is his relationship over the years with his motif and how he translates this in art (in later videos he draws female faces like goldfish), but even this lacks a real comprehension. Also, with his high-framed images, he really tries to enter his audience's subconscious and maybe if you're high you could see in this how a flying goldfish created the universe.Overall, it's your typical Tanaami work, with buried sexual imagery, weird sound and music juxtaposed with his inner world. No real surrealism, but more looking at oneself with postmodern eyes. At 82 as this year, he still has expositions and his art is still blooming. And don't worry, it will not induce a weird fetish for goldfish.;Mixed Feelings

Anime from this era are silent and all black and white. Many of them were poorly preserved, but this one looks ok. Its basically created to teach a moral lesson, as you would expect anime of this time to do. The story is about crabs who are taken advantage of by a monkey. It teaches that its ok to share with some people, as the crabs did with the bees, but there are some people who will take advantage of you. Its actually a pretty cute animation, and if you want to try 1939 anime this may be a good starting point considering its not confusing war propaganda and its also fairly well preserved over the years.;Recommended

0;Propagate;sourfrog;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sourfrog;2;I have seen a lot of dementia anime shorts, and this one does not stand out as anything special. It is apparently about the cycle of a plant, which can be guessed because of the words that pop up three times on screen. If you want to make an in-depth analysis on what every scene represents I'm sure you could, but it would be a waste of time. Most of the story is just black and white geometric shapes just switching colors on the screen.The geometric shapes do not really do much, so there is not much to say about the art unless you really like pointy things.There was no sound. I was left with my bedroom window open only to hear my neighbors listening to 70s hits and partying, wondering why I was not doing something I enjoy instead of watching this nonsense for four minutes.No characters either, just a plant and some lines.I enjoyed the parts where the words were on screen so I could finally tell what I was watching.Overall, this may be the kind of anime you have to watch several times to fully understand what it was about. I won't, but if you are reading this, go ahead and watch it several times to interpret it fully. I have better things to do.;Not Recommended

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also GlassesBoi's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Aruite Mikka truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in GlassesBoi's existential catchphrase “Ochinchin sugoi desu,” which itself is a geniusly outplanned reference to humanitys downfall. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as i touch myself with GlassesBoi in thought...

Yeah, it's just a box—the imagery is sometimes suspended inside of the box, and it will rotate and you can see the dimensions, and in the top square of the box, there is sometimes the sky—so it's a bit like an extra-expansive kind of imagery, just as you might get with a panoramic image. It's pretty experimental. Other times the box will disappear and you just see one of the whole images from one of the squares on the box, and Ito will move the camera back and forth in a repetitive, mechanistic fashion. It's more creative than some of his other earliest shorts and more technically impressive, but it's also boring and the imagery chosen to fill the frame is terrible.

The plot of this season really centers around the imperial family's power struggle, and them using the friction within the divide the tomb factions (raiders and guards) to achieve their goals. Interestingly enough, this season's focus isn't as much on tomb raid/guarding and instead has alot of political manuvering. That said, this is still an enjoyable watch, the fights are good and the plot is quite interesting. Some of the plot threads in the previous seasons get expanded/resolved here.

0;Nodoka Mori no Doubutsu Daisakusen;herbeey;https://myanimelist.net/profile/herbeey;6;This has a similar premise to Pom Poko. That's why I watched it. I watched it to the end and enjoyed it just enough to be glad I watched it. I like how it has a forest full of animals, each with their own personalities specific to their species. It's very endearing. It's like getting a sneak preview as to what a forest of animals would be like if they could talk. You even get to see what domesticated animals are like in contrast, which is really interesting. Oh, and there's a faery of the forest, which appeals to me.If that doesn't sound pretty interesting, I'd recommend giving this a miss. It isn't amazing or even that good but it is a cute kids' anime movie. It reminds me more of american cartoons than regular anime, which isn't really a good thing.If you watch it, watch it until you see the forest animals interacting with each other, and then decide whether it's for you. From that point on, there's not long human scenes and there is plenty of animals interacting. There will be no surprises. You either like it enough to watch it by that point or you don't.;Mixed Feelings

0;Shin Takarajima;BobSamurai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BobSamurai;7;"I was pleasantly surprised with Osamu Tezuka's Shin Takarajima, or ""New Treasure Island."" Thankfully, it has nothing to do with Tezuka's 1-volume manga by the same name. I just thought it was boring and anti-climactic. Surprisingly, I think Shin Takarajima is the best-directed movie-length project of its time. It's basically a bunch of anthropomorphic animals on a ship searching for treasure. At an hour-long, it's got a solid introduction, comedic indirect characterization, and enough exposition to understand its simple treasure hunt plot without feeling long-winded. In addition, there's an enjoyable build-up with foreshadowing and intriguing developments leading the crew to plot against each other. Lastly, it's got an exciting climax where the animators went into overtime, leading to a satisfying conclusion.While I've never read Robert Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" novel to comment on the anime's originality or lack thereof, my experience was better for it. The anime took me back to my childhood watching some dusty vintage black VHS cassettes around the house. Its comedic style feels similar to what's eventually shown in the first Puss in Boots anime, where it's very western and somewhat slapstick but exaggerated. At times, it's chaos, like when they first discover the treasure map. Everyone goes crazy to board up the room to scheme in secret. This guy pulls a painting off the wall to cover the fireplace and blindfolds it just in case it's one of those cliche eyeball cutout paintings. I think it's totally worth a watch if you're into the vintage cartoon aesthetic, and it's also perfect for kids. I give it a 7. Of course, it's not nearly as beautiful as earlier Toei works I've scored lower, but its writing, animation, and scope all match. It's not ambitious, but it lives up to expectations of its shallow scope.This was just an excerpt from a video script I'm writing on 60's anime, it's not a great review, but there weren't any other reviews yet and I think its pretty underrated here, so I hope this helps new people to enjoy it.";Recommended
0;Yankee Reppuu-tai;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"“Yankee Reppuu-tai” follows the exploits of charismatic goofball and fighting genius Monnojo Monda and his friends and enemies as he ascends the ranks of the juvenile delinquent gang world.The ""Reppuu-tai"" is a legendary gang that is said to have been disbanded after its leader retired. The main character, Monnojo, is a sort of ""lone wolf"" delinquent whose dream is to join the Reppuu-tai. He rides around in his junker car that has a souped-up engine, with his girlfriend Mari and friend (with a manji haircut) Tetsu, looking for fights and races to be had. After a chance encounter with a liquor store worker who looks like Ronald McDonald, he finds out that the Reppuu-tai has not disbanded but is indeed alive and well.And then, as luck would have it, we find out that the retired head of the Reppuu-tai, who knows Monnojo, has selected him to be its next head! And the Ronald McDonald guy just happens to be a member!That sets the tone for this OVA, and more coincidences follow that seriously test one’s suspension of disbelief. The six episodes are chock full of nonsensical violence, all in the name of being “manly.” People seek out Monnojo to fight him, Monnojo beats them handily, and they become absolutely enamored with his manliness and either demand to become his underlings or that he join their gangs. There’s lots of stabbing, punching, and car crashing, with characters getting hospitalized frequently. But miraculously, with the exception of someone in a flashback, no one dies! And even after sustaining serious internal injuries and blood loss, they’re all pretty much good to go and ready to fight again after just a few days. These guys are essentially superhumans.There is also a lot of “comedy” spliced in with the violence. Monnojo goes from tough guy to goofball at the drop of a hat, confusing his opponents and bewildering his followers. Tetsu, his friend, is mostly there for comedic relief; he’s basically a wannabe delinquent, but despite his tough appearance, he’s not “manly” enough to stand on equal footing with the rest of the gang. Some “comedy” is also derived from perverted jokes, usually made by Monnojo towards his girlfriend, Mari. (I put “comedy” in quotes because most of the jokes fall flat.)That brings me to the ladies of the OVA — there are 4 main female characters here — 3 who are girlfriends of the main characters, and one who is from a rival gang and looks like Carmen Sandiego. Although this is very much a “manly” OVA focused on fights, the female characters get a fair amount of development and screentime, and aren’t just there as accessories for the guys. The guys are also steadfastly loyal to their girlfriends, despite various temptations, which is refreshing.As far as technical aspects go, the animation is not bad. It's not amazing by any means, but it's above average. The character designs are unusual. You have your typical ""delinquent""-looking characters, but some of them, including Monnojo in particular, also have these weird black, doe-like eyes. And their faces will often become cartoon-like when they're saying/doing something funny. Many of the characters have larger-than-life hairstyles that make them look like toy poodles. There are 3 characters (1 female, 2 male) with almost the same exact color hair and hairstyle, and they were hard to tell apart at first.There are some interesting effects with the colors from the vehicle lights bleeding into the rest of the scene, kind of like a watercolor painting. In critical scenes, sometimes the colors become inverted, or change to black and red, which is an interesting touch. The music is OK, but not that memorable; just an average-sounding rock-and-roll soundtrack. The voice acting is good, as they got some of the most popular voice actors at the time to star in this. However, their talent is often wasted on cliched lines like “I’ll kill you,” “What did you say,” etc.Regarding objectionable content, besides the aforementioned violence and tough talk, there is a fair amount of nudity, particularly in the first and second episodes. There are also perverted jokes from time to time. Also, story-wise, there is a female character who falls in love with the guy who beat her up and sent her to the hospital, and they start dating. (He scarred his face in front of her as “atonement” for what he did, and that made her fall for him. It’s still weird, though.)This OVA is watchable, but due to the too-convenient series of coincidences required to drive the plot forward, the characters sustaining life-threatening injuries but somehow coming out of them unscathed, the objectionable content, and the odd designs of some of the characters, it’s not a particularly enjoyable watch. Not to mention the whole thing feels pointless. It seems like they’re beating each other up to the brink of death just to see how “manly” they all are. If that’s your thing, then you might like this, but if you want more substance, it’s best to look elsewhere.";Mixed Feelings
0;Shin Karate Jigoku-hen;Kraanerg;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kraanerg;7;Based on a manga written by Kajiwara Ikki, well-known for Ashita no Joe. What most western people have no idea is the fact Ikki was a revolutionary gekiga artist on writing absurd works depicting harsh reality, with poverty and cruelty on focus. I have no idea how this OVA adapted the original manga, since these rental-VHS-only releases are specially awful, but the results are such of a masterpiece of ultimately trashy anime. It starts very idiotic then gets over-the-top brutal and nihilist, without losing its cheap charm. You have a cheesy karate and yakuza plot conflicting with WW2 and italian/nazi political themes. Eventually you'll find suicide, abuse, racism, the exploitation of minors and natives. If you think you had enough of those themes.. well, you don't know how those are presented in here. What about an old fat grandma into BDSM creatively leading your torture, humiliation and rape, finding a way to roast you alive beyond medieval? I mean, the grandpa whipping scene is already strange enough. Now imagine this same grandma naked and tied to a boat. Can't believe I lived enough to watch a scene like that. With psychological/physical violence and shitty artwork hand in hand, the level of cheesiness x background social commentary x gross vileness is way out of balance.

0;Shin Karate Jigoku-hen;needmorecampari;https://myanimelist.net/profile/needmorecampari;2;This is pretty dire.Watching the protagonist slip from one group of horrible people to another, witnessing brutal acts of sick violence and desperate vengeance, starts to feel a little nihilistic. Suicide, murder, torture, sexual assault, racism—this OVA plumbs the depths of the worst things humans can do to each other, so much so that our karate champ often wonders why humans can be so depraved. As a viewer, I started to wonder what the moviemakers were trying to get at. Why tell this story in this way? It's certainly not subtle. In some ways the OVA seemed to bump against the edge of exploitation, as if the viewer should get some perverse thrill from watching a naked, screaming woman roast inside a cage perched on a burning tree.Story and themes aside, the animation is pretty crude. The characters are dully designed and the animators did not work too hard to maintain any faithfulness to the style sheet. Music is forgettable and the sound effects are from the standard anime bank of sound effects heard a thousand times over. There were several false brand names and logos to avoid copyright infringement (e.g. PanNam airlines), but the novelty of spotting those did not make up for the OVA's other shortcomings.Honestly, I only finished it so I could feel legitimate when writing this negative review.;Not Recommended

Its a story about a young salesman, Hou Mo, who inadvertently gets caught in the middle of a war between nightcrawlers. These are group of people who have special abilities enhanced by various animal genes depending on their bloodline. In the process he discovers he has the Lingming Stone Monkey bloodline. Of course this bloodline comes with a unique set of problems and he must go on a quest in order to survive his fate and improve himself... while around him all hell breaks lose.It's a simple plot of overcoming tribulations while upgrading the MC from zero to hero. It's fast paced with lots of action, creatures, cultivation and superpowers. The episodes, however feel a bit rushed and it is sometimes difficult to follow the story due to translation issues. Humor was also sometimes lost, or scenes that were not intended to be funny were hilarious due to bad translation... like when someone throws a sugar-coated cannonball.The MC, Hou Mo, in his normal form is a little boring, but his transformation design is super awesome. I suspect a lot of the animation budget was spent on making him look OP. At times it's a mix of the great special effects and his monkey character design that carries the donghua. There is a variety of interactions between other characters, but not enough time is given for relationships to feel developed.As is typical with limited budget Chinese animations, the overall quality of animation, sound and translation is, in places, lacking. Fight scenes are energetic, and any flaws were hidden by the superb special effects. I love the opening soundtrack, but feel they ran out of steam for the closing.It is a fun watch, full of action, great creature designs, somewhat scantily dressed woman and an MC (when transformed) that is eye candy... excuse me... brave and heroic to look at. I'm sure there are deeper messages behind the donghua, but that, to me at least, was lost in translation.I'd recommend it to anyone who likes action, mythology and has an open mind towards Chinese animation styles.";Recommended

The artwork is perfunctory with simple character designs and background artwork ranging from okay to pretty nice. Animation is also perfunctory and unimpressive, but it gets the job done.

I-I don't know what to do with you. I would recommend therapy and suggest you rethink your answer but i am not you. Generally speaking it is a firm no.As for the ending, let me say it was a hoot. Sure, it could have been a simple ending like the end but no it was one we generally search for on the web. The one where one is slightly ridiculed for not being strong enough by a female voice to boot and implied need for emotional support. If you can't figure out what i am referring to i strongly advise watching this. It is nice and short so don't complain about lack of time.Art wiseWonderful. Couldn't be any better. Each frame while quick since whole animation is 15 or so seconds is easily recognizable. The art of warfare to be simple. Animation is nice and crisp along with the color. But that ending i don't think i could have painted a better one if i tried. Sure it doesn't require much artist talent to mimic but the message it conveys is quite relate-able.SoundNot a bad beat for a quick fill in music tempo. I think if i had this on a loop of some kind i may use it play some games i have.;Recommended
0;Shounen to Sakura;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;6;While nothing special, this is still a nice little short story with a nice message. In the terrible hardship immediately following the second world war, a young boy and his mother are struggling just to survive. The boy comes across an old man caring for a cherry tree -- and through his actions, he is able to show how strength and perseverance through hardship pays off.The artwork is serviceable but unexceptional. The story is also simple and straightforward, although maybe a bit maudlin. But even still, it's a nice and short tale.One thing to remember is at the time this anime was made, the little boy would be in his forties. The memories of the war and its aftermath were still very fresh in the collective memory of the country, as well as the individual memories of its citizens. You can bet that the people who worked on this drew upon their own memories to accurately portray every little detail about post-war Japan. This was not just some historical story, but this was a personal reminiscence of their own earlier lives.;Mixed Feelings
1;Shounen to Sakura;Kayo-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kayo-;5;"This tiny OVA is something you would usually remember from Elementary School. It's not a bad episode, just not something you would really recommend anybody to watch because as i said, it seems its directed audience is pointed towards children. Because of that i will rate the story a 6.I really do enjoy the old art styles of anime. I wish more anime nowadays would adapt the oldish art style look into their anime. I give the art a 6 as well.The sound of this is what you would expect when you watch an older children's show, bland. It's nothing too spectacular to really drool over but at the same time it isn't bad. My rating for sound is 4.The characters in this show are really neat. I like the Oldman and how he was always in a good mood even after the events you see when you start. I like the boy being curious and learning throughout the show. His mom is also a cool character because of how she works to keep the boy happy at home.My enjoyment of this show is gonna have to be a four. If this show was a 5 episode series, i wouldn't finish it; Not because it's bad, it's just... boring.Overall i will give this series a 5 overall.

0;SmaSTATION-3 SMAnime;Bigbone99;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bigbone99;9;"This going to be a very short review because there isn't too much to say about this collection of shorts. SMAnime are three shorts about as long as an anime OP. They were directed by Takeshi Koike of Redline fame and they're meant to be advertising a concert. I couldn't tell you what kind of concert it was from the shorts because the seem so far removed from it and there were no subtitles. As for the shorts themselves they're freaking awesome. I wouldn't want to spoil the contents of the shorts but what I can say is that they are opulently animated absurdity. Koike as an animator is known to be a bit ""extra"" by exaggerating proportionality and depth of field as well as cramming what feels like ten thousand frames and detailed character designs in his cuts. So it's more Koike goodness, hence why I'm rating it so highly: the art and animation stand out on their own. So who is this for? I guess if you wanna deep dive into his career, then this is an interesting stop. If you like cool animation, this is for you as well. Otherwise you're not really missing out. But if this piqued your curiosity, its not a bad way to spend about 5 minutes. And it's all an easy Youtube search away too!";Recommended

0;Machi Ichiban no Kechinbou;shootermcshoot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shootermcshoot;5;A very condensed version of the Dickens novel. It's occasionally re-run here in the U.S. along with all those old Rankin-Bass specials with the stop motion animation at around 1 in the morning long after they've replayed Elf or National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation for the 200th time. They don't run it every year, but definitely every couple of years. In fact, I thought it was just another Rankin-Bass animated cartoon, I didn't realize it was Japanese. It's a very average version of the story (Although the portion with Jacob Marley and the other ghosts is actually quite terrifying and that portion is sometimes cut from the rebroadcast). Walter Matthau played grouchy curmudgeons his entire career, so he is sufficiently well cast as Scrooge, but the whole thing just feels rushed and the animation is actually quite poor in spots.;Mixed Feelings

Some of the corpuscles sound like UFO’s, ray guns, sputtering coffee pots, sticky shoes, whining doors, candy dispensers, and even like a crowded room of people!Actually, maybe I imagined that last one.

0;Koguma no Misha;kokuro;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kokuro;9;I watched this anime when I was a kid (about 16 or 17 years ago) and still remember the details of this great watch. This is enough to say that the characters and the stories of this anime are really memorable. I even at times find myself remembering a funny moment of this anime after all these years and chuckle. That said, the following is obviously my personal view of this anime and is not necessarily something everyone might agree with.Story: 8/10This anime has a great start. Misha (a grizzly bear cub) is traveling with his parents on a train. Along the way the train has a quick stop in a village where nobody has seen a train in years. Naturally most of the curious villagers (the most eager one is the owner of the hotel that is going bankrupt) gather at the station to see the train and Misha's father -a positive thinker- thinks that they've gathered up to welcome them and decides to stay there. What he doesn't know is that most of the villagers either do not care for them or even dislike them. In this fashion Misha's new life start. As the anime goes on in each episode we get to know about different families and animals that live in the village and the way they interact with each other but most of the stories are about Misha and other kids. Misha is very adventurous and kind and he tries to befriend all the kids in town but not all of them welcome his presence and their rivalry and jealousy at times creates very funny events.The story might sound familiar or overused but this anime has a very unique and refreshing approach towards this subject and the comedy livens the situations most of the time.Art and Sound: 8/10 & 6/10Art and animation of this anime is very simple. This anime is almost 30 years old so I can't really talk about the quality of the animation compared to what we see today however if I want to compare it to other anime i used to watch as a kid, I can easily give the art and animation of this anime an 8/10. What stands out the most is the character designs of this series. In my opinion the character designs are amazingly fit to the characters and theme of the show.I watched this anime dubbed. However a few years ago I got the chance to watch a few short clips of the anime in Japanese and I really liked the voice acting. I do not recall anything special about the music of this anime but I heard the opening theme again and from my current point of view it wasn't bad at all.Character: 9/10One of the strongest points of this anime is characters. The characters are likable, memorable, unique and well developed. Although there are many characters in this anime, almost every one of them is well developed. Most of them have many different sides to them and they are given the chance in the stories to show different qualities about themselves.Enjoyment: 9/10I really enjoyed watching this anime and think that it's a fun watch. Not only I as a kid but also my parents and my older sister and brother enjoyed the show. I had many laughs while watching it and even after 17 years or so still remember many of the episodes and the funny moments in them. It has some dramatic episodes as well but even the drama is mixed with a clever comedy. The characters' likability and the interesting stories all make this watch worthwhile. Therefore I really recommend this show to anyone regardless of their age.Thanks for reading.;Recommended
0;Pikaia!!;Timz0r;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Timz0r;7;"Following the events of the first season, the second season of this educational anime aimed for kids has some improvements if I must say compaired with the first season. The formula is still the same compaired with the first season as we first start with a recap of previous episode, followed by the main episoe and it ends with some trivia that digs a little deeper what you have seen during the episode. So let's dig a little deeper into this anime, shall we?Story: 7/10 (Good)Since the Cambria Project got scrapped (and probably because they ran out of famous Cambrian species left to cover - hehe), we now explore a small part of the Paleozoic world that's left behind by time. Humans still live in space as a colony due Earth being unhabitable. You can tell the story got a bit improved nonetheless. It's also a bit darker, since in the anime they now speak of The Sixth Mass Extinction; a current event that's actully happening right now due human activity. Wendy has become a main charather now due moral reasons. First the trio explore the Devonian sea whats now the Atlas Mountains of Marocco, a fossil locality I'm very familiar within the field myself. Then we go the the late Devonian of the North American Appalachian Mountains. After that we explore the Carboniferous Westphalian what's now eastern Canada. We pay a visit to the early Permian, more to be precise the Cisuralian. You know, the era of the synapsid Dimetrodon sp. Finally, we visit the late Permian; when almost the entire planet died out approx. 252 million years ago in the Changhsingian. The story teaches kids a bit more about extinction, one of those words most people don't like to hear.Art-style: 5/10 (Average)I think the art-style remains the same to me like previous season. Please don't think that I dislike it though. It's just that I dislike the combination between CGI & (computer) drawn animation. The prehistoric animals you get to see are still bad CGI in my opinion which I find a bit of a shame.Sound: 6/10 (Fine)I really can't trash talk the voice acting, even for this anime. The music is cute and suitable for kids that like to explore the unknown. It's fine like it is, honest!Charathers: 6/10 (Fine)It feels the charathers are a bit more fleshed out, which feels very refreshing to say to least if you compair it with previous season. You see more charather development and such, which is a good thing, right? We also have new charathers like Will & Harry, that now help out Morris while Professor Parker is somewhere behind the scenes doing things, but he gets screentime. We also finally get to see Frazer, I mean Captain Frazer that got mentioned in the first season.Enjoyment: 8/10 (Very Good)This show was pretty much ""What is this Paleozoic animal?"" for me, but I did enjoyed it. It was fun to see my favorite Devonian fish in an anime. I even learned something new about dragonfly's thier wings that I didn't knew.Overall: 7/10 (Good)In overall, since I could tell there are quite some improvements compaired with previous season, I'd like to give this anime a 7 out of 10 just because this anime isn't shy for mentioning we're basicly fucking up the planet in a fun way in an anime. It still bothers me the episodes are so short though. But then again; this anime is aimed for kids, so I can understand that.";Recommended

Animation itself is naturally good, they have huge budgets. Voice acting is so-so, donghuas tend to have pretty bad voice acting, they don't have the emotion that their japanese counterparts do, but they do get saved by their great animation and way better written plots.

0;Komadori Movie: Komaneko;Denizu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Denizu;8;"Komaneko: The Curious Cat is a simple, quiet, and charming stop motion film comprised of a few short stories that revolve around a kitten who enjoys arts and crafts and recording things with his camera. There is no dialogue, aside from Komaneko's occasional ""nyaa!"", it's just cute music and adorable animation with cute stories that are mainly about friendship.The main reason why I like this film so much is because it used stop motion animation, which is my favorite, and because there is no dialogue. The quiet and slow pacing makes it relaxing to watch, and at times very much like watching an ASMR video, if you are familiar with that. I actually didn't get through this hour long film the first time I watched it because it put me to sleep, but then again it was very late and I had initially put it on to amuse my son, who was wired and refused to lie down. Komaneko did the trick. As soon as he saw the kitten moving about on screen he calmed down and within moments leaned his head onto my chest and that was it. I could have simply shut it off but I was getting into it, until I eventually dozed off myself.I'd say Komaneko is suitable for quiet movie time. It actually reminded me of the old stop motion Christmas Specials I used to watch every year on TV, like Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and A Year Without A Santa Clause. So if you like quiet stop motion shorts that will make your kids shut up so you can get some rest, this may be a good choice.";Recommended

It's a dark job this spirit has, going on and giving the final push, but she believes in the beauty of life, which leads to moments of showing happiness when the bright times come. She's an odd character though, but maybe a new one for the job. Her reactions seem a bit off at times but for the most part, what she does is really heartfelt and moving. It's true with the main guy here as well with the life he lives. The narrative here, though short, is pretty good stuff.What really speaks out as well as the great audiovisuals. I have come to like quite a bit of Rabbit MACHINE's MVs, and this one was on another level. It looks good in every way. The music has a good melody too and fits the overall theme of this MV. It comes across as hopeful in these disheartening times. But that is the motivation that would only make sense here if one were to live in such a place.It's a great MV. Just listen to it.

0;Double Hard;hamsteralliance;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hamsteralliance;7;"The world of Double Hard is one of turf warfare. Rival gangs, often on motorcycle, fight it out in the streets to secure territory. Sunglasses, leather jackets, big hair, and face scars abound. Rank seemingly determined by how big your chin is.It's a series where thugs intimidate people in dark alleyways. Where lackeys express concern to their gang leader, only to receive a beat down for not having total faith in their boss. Where everyone is cocky to a fault. There's also a lot of knife licking.Perhaps an image has formed in your mind and you know exactly what this series is. You've likely watched something like it before, as it's not really anything new. But it is also based on a manga from 1994, so it's really not anything new.That said, I found it thoroughly enjoyable. The art style is very reminiscent of old fighting games, say Tekken or Virtua Fighter. Which is really the whole vibe of the show. If you've played those games and seen their cutscenes, Double Hard is like that.

While the donghua introduces alot of ideas, cool gadgets and drops alot of hints (mystery element), it ultimately doesn't make use of them all, especially the gadgets.

0;Feng Qi Luoyang Zhi Shen Ji Shaonian;Icqa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Icqa;6;"Luoyang Divine Youth review (contains non-explicit spoilers)OverviewLuoyang Divine Youth, or its mononym Luoyang, is a historically-inspired donghua that combines fantasy elements from the Wu Zhou period. A verdict on the imperial examination has impeded the interests of traditional aristocrats. During this time, Pei Kun came to the city Luoyang and got entangled in the ""fox demon"" case as a wanted man. His persistence in catching the felon led to his involvement in the conspiracy of the Chun Qiu clan. Alongside Li Ying and those of the imperial court, Pei Kun tears apart this massive conspiracy to achieve his original goal.Story & character: 7/10 and 5/10This donghua goes on a slow pace to build up depth. I was pretty surprised it could fit the main storyline into 16 episodes with fillers for Pei Kun and Li Ying, princess of Tang’s relationship. Everything was set in stone from the first episode until it threw in more hooks and pinch points, which made keeping up with the story a bit perplexing. The most notable episode was episode 8 because it revealed current events but not everything for obscurity.I like how it showed each character's reason for actions because of their struggles (such as the Shangguang siblings' misunderstanding, Li Ying’s “betrayal,” etc.). What I did not enjoy is that most of the introduced characters exist for the sake of others. They are “disposed” or forgotten about later on after events that fit accordingly to their principle (mainly Bai He’s wasted development in the season finale).Art & Sound: 7/10 & 6/10There is nothing special about sound. However, there are some notable things about art. The fight scenes are pleasing to look at; they successfully capture fluidity during most of the character’s stunts. I appreciate this donghua's efforts in designing extras and scenery according to its period, which is a bonus for me. Some sets have a drastic change in quality when characters are standing in sunlight or any bright light. It creates a blur effect or an unrealistic glow on their faces, but it is not something that ruins the experience.Overall and enjoyment: 6/10The mystery elements captivated me. The number of vaguely answered questions by foreshadowing hinted at a sequel, but there is no information about a second season (as of writing this). I expected the story to have a play on politics, but the mix of fantasy and vitality themes is not so bad. A 6 is fair, so I consider this a decent donghua to watch.";Mixed Feelings

0;Tokyo Futago Athletic;potor10;https://myanimelist.net/profile/potor10;10;I have no words for this masterpieceBut if I was forced to write something, It would be something like this:Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one.;Recommended

0;Cello Hiki no Gauche;RetroAnimeMike;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RetroAnimeMike;7;"Performing classical music is stressful, and this makes a successful concert all the more satisfying. This is what we see in Gauche as he struggles to master his cello pieces, always facing harsh criticism from the conductor. There is a saying: if you want to learn something, teach it. Gauche is visited by animals while he spends his nights rehearsing at the water mill, and the ambiguity of these scene is the crux of this short puppet play. Is he dreaming? In any event, it shows emotional maturity on part of the creators how he first greets his visitors with fury and comes to appreciate their nighttime intrusions by degrees. As he helps these animals and gives them lessons, he himself progresses with his performing, until he is the one to give encore at the conclusion of the concert; even the conductor praises him. A simple heartwarming story meant for children, this work suffers a bit from poor production quality, but again, is it poor for 1963? The music is the best part of this feature, as is only natural given the theme. All in all, an enjoyable short film that doesn't have huge ambitions.";Recommended

Just a short spectacular selling device. Nescafé Hong Kong TV CM is no different. It isn't special but it still does a good job of selling what it does.I am not going to deconstruct this as if it were a general TV anime since there is a clear objective to the commercial.

Again, it isn't special, but the eye candy and the anticipation of sweetness, if you are like me who loves to watch a good commercial, this isn't one to skip over. It is in Japanese and whatever language the people of Hong Kong use.

This is going to be a little more open-minded and fair.There doesn't seem to be any definitive plot or narrative. It's basically animals wrestling each other. It seems more like a project that was meant for the fun of it rather than try and tell an actual story. I feel ""other reviewers"" judge it too harshly instead of appreciating it for what it is. I also think it was straight forward and easy to understand. It's not exactly a David Lynch film in which a lot of thought is needed.The story is basically animals wrestling each other for the most part like I said.The art was perfectly fine and the animation was actually quite good for 1934.. At least for a Japanese animation. We don't even know if it was done by a studio or just one person. If it was done by one person, consider me impressed.There was no sound. It's a cheaply made anime short from 1934.The characters were mostly animals. I remember seeing deer, rabbits, monkeys, and bears. There was also an overweight man and a lumberjack. The characters didn't have a whole lot of personality or time focused on them due to the anime only being seven minutes long.I enjoyed the anime overall. I'm a sucker for the classics and anything that paved the way for the things that came after. It's pretty important and all should appreciate these early examples of Japanese animation.Overall 6/10.I don't see how anyone could logically give it lower than a 5. It's not bad and I think the people who think this way are most likely between the ages of 8 & 17. They feel anything that's older than the year 20XX is automatically bad without taking into consideration it's importance and what it meant at the time it came out.Also shame on you if you're actually reading this long ass review for a seven minute long anime from 1934. There really isn't much to say about it for you to be this curious. Everything you need to know is in the anime which you could have finished by now.";Mixed Feelings

0;Hidari no O'Clock!!;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;6;"“Hidari no O'Clock!!” is a coming-of-age story that is engaging and largely competently made, although its plot is laden with melodrama and cliches.The 2-episode OVA is split into 4 separate parts, and centers on Yuu, a high schooler who basically has a midlife crisis and doesn’t see the point in taking tests, going to school or even waking up in the morning. Encouraged by his older sister, he dusts off his old motorbike and decides to ride across Japan, with the country’s northernmost point as his first goal. He makes lots of mistakes along the way, but also makes friends and helps people he comes across with their various issues, all the while thinking of Aoi, his childhood friend back home who has a crush on him.The first part, which sets up the story, is arguably the strongest of the bunch, but the other three parts, which show him traveling across Japan and helping people he encounters, aren’t bad; they’re just full of predictable conclusions and saccharine melodrama. They have the kind of storylines you’ve probably seen played out dozens of times before, and the last part in particular borders on unbelievable at times with how neatly everything is wrapped up.Since this is only two episodes, the characters don’t get too much development and are essentially one-dimensional, with the exception of the main character, Yuu. He changes a bit too quickly, but some of that could be attributed to time skips within the OVA itself. He starts as someone who’s rather despondent and emotionless, and then suddenly is outspoken and freely talking to strangers and even getting involved in their lives, and it’s kind of a jarring change. Aoi is your typical model student and childhood-friend-of-the-main-character-who-has-a-crush-on-them type you often see in anime. Yuu’s parents basically leave most of the parenting to his older sister, Moe, who often enlists her friend Tetsuo to help Yuu out. These two characters are likable. Most of the characters Yuu meets on his journey are okay, and Koichi, who travels with him, is somewhat annoying and a stereotypical Kansai person, but he grows on you after a while.The technical aspects of this series are all above average. The voice acting is decent; the music is catchy and nostalgic, with a bit of a 1960s feel; the animation is pretty good, especially during the motorcycle riding scenes; the character designs are very shoujo-like and appealing (typical Kaoru Shintani designs), and the direction is good.There is not a whole lot of objectionable content in this OVA, at least visually. There is some slight inadvertent nudity shown briefly, some accidental inappropriate touching of female characters, and a character just casually smoking inside a hospital. In the dialogue, there are a number of sexist remarks that are played off as being cute or funny, particularly one where a policeman says to a couple that the father of one of them, who just approved their marriage, wants to see a grandchild ASAP. Most of this objectionable content can be attributed to the time this OVA came out.Overall, “Hidari no O’Clock!!” is a decent OVA, although it would have been nice if there was at least one more episode (it ends on a good note, but the story feels incomplete). Currently there is no English-language version available, but this series seems like prime fansubbing material, so hopefully there will be an English version at some point in the future. If cliches and melodrama don’t bother you, and you like seeing a character traveling around the country to find themselves, give this one a try.";Mixed Feelings
0;Sekai Douwa Anime Zenshuu;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;6;“Sekai Douwa Anime Zenshuu” is a 10-episode series of fairy tales which was originally sold as a box set either in 1986 or 1990 (sources vary on this). Each episode had an English dub and sub version, and came with a corresponding cassette tape and booklet with the script in both Japanese and English, as well as coloring book pictures. The idea was for this series to be used as English educational material for kids.I watched the Japanese version (with English subs), and while it’s nothing groundbreaking in any respect, it’s still decent if you consider it as a primer on some classic fairy tales, or a “Fairy Tales 101” of sorts.Each episode is roughly 10 minutes long and features a different story. Most of the stories are included in Grimms’ Fairy Tales, but there are a couple of non-Grimms’ ones as well, namely “Little Black Sambo” and “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.” Some of the stories progress rather strangely, and have considerable leaps in logic in them. However, when I researched the original tales, I found them to be very similar, so bizarre as some of these stories may be, they are relatively faithful to the traditional versions.The animation and voice acting are consistent throughout the series. They’re nothing special, but they get the job done. There isn’t really any music other than the background music (which isn’t memorable), or the bonus “ABC Song” video, which is just the ABC Song, which is okay but doesn’t leave much of an impression.Although this is made for kids, there are some potentially troublesome instances in most of the stories (although I wouldn’t go as far as saying explicit). Of note is the inclusion of “Little Black Sambo,” which is considered a controversial tale due to how it visually depicts Africans. There is also an odd scene in “Snow White” where the prince, coming across Snow White and thinking that she’s dead, lifts her body out of the casket to kiss her. Some of the lessons the tales espouse are questionable (like in “Puss in Boots,” where the moral seems to be “lying to everyone will bring you success in life”). There are also scenes where death and suicide are portrayed positively.Overall, I’m not sure if “Sekai Douwa Anime Zenshuu” is particularly effective at its original purpose of helping kids learn English, but it’s certainly a good introduction to various fairy tales, since the stories are similar to the originals. It’s visually and aurally average, and there are strange scenes and questionable morals promoted in some of the tales, but on the whole it’s not bad. Recommended if you’re interested in learning about fairy tales.;Mixed Feelings

Well let´s begin, this is an indie short anime film, so that would be unfair to use regular standsarts to judge this one, but even with that, we can´t really save much from it.""Tough Guy!"" Tells the story of a praying Mants (that is just called tough guy) that is passionated by martial arts adn wants to become strong, and basically every ""act"" or episode is based on his journey to do it, yes it is a movie but it shows those act changes between the scenes, i will not spoil anything but basically every act is about a main rival for him, and it is also very comic related, so if you had any hope this was some real battle movie about a mantis please stop haha, it is really fun, especially the act about human interations.Speaking about technically talking the movie is pretty bad, the sound quality and the image is pretty bad, but the animation is not THAT bad, its definitely low, but not shitty, the main probably is the dub, there is no sub to it, even in japanese, and you cant really forgive that because the quality is terrible, you cant hear pretty much nothing they say, you get things from watching the scene and taking the context of it and from reading the texts in between acts.In the end, it is one of those underated and unknow anime/japanse works that are really weird but worth checking because in the end it is art and makes you see how diffferent ideias people have and create, so if you have 6 minutes to check it and wants too, i would say look for some Studio Colorido short, but if you really want, check to forum post discussion for this anime and there is a link to watch it.

0;Ogami Matsugorou;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;6;"Although it has questionable production values and a meandering story, “Ogami Matsugoro” is a decent OVA. It’s about a high school delinquent named Matsugoro Ogami, who is known as ""Praying Matsugoro"" (a pun on his surname in Japanese) for how he prays for his victims after he defeats them in fights. Fighting is all he knows, and it's all he's got... until a chance encounter with Koume Nagasaki, the daughter of the headmistress of a kindergarten that is plagued by yakuza. He falls in love with her at first sight, but she absolutely abhors violence! This is a problem, since violence is his way of life. He fights the yakuza threatening to take the kindergarten's land away, but this makes Koume upset. Violence is bad, you see. So he comes up with creative ways to help out the kindergarten, like having his underlings help make repairs to the place, and eating the land handover contract the yakuza coerced Koume's mother into signing. He does eventually fight them when she's unconscious or out of sight, though.The 46-minute OVA meanders through 5 or 6 connected stories, so it feels like more than one episode. After Matsugoro’s initial encounter with Koume, there’s an arm wrestling competition at a ramen restaurant, a dance at a school festival, a girl gang out to get revenge on Matsugoro whose leader ends up falling for him, a “date” with the gang leader, and the climax — the kidnapping of Koume, in which Matsugoro and co. come to the rescue.The plot takes its time to progress and drags a bit in some parts, but things do go from point A to point B, and the progression feels natural. It ends in a satisfying, although somewhat open-ended, conclusion. Some stuff happens that’s a bit unrealistic, like rough fights where participants remain relatively unscathed, lethal wounds that apparently aren’t so lethal, and other such fare that is par for the course for delinquent anime series. Also, when fights break out, there are conveniently no police or anyone else around to break them up. The whole thing is rather lighthearted and comedic in tone, despite the serious subject matter.Since this is a one-episode OVA, the characters don’t get much development, and most of them are downright one-dimensional. Koume’s personality is basically “violence = bad,” and her dream is to operate a kindergarten. Matsugoro is a delinquent with a heart of gold who is impossibly strong. Kyoko is your typical delinquent girl gang leader who acts tough, but melts into a puddle when confronted with Matsugoro’s manliness. The rest of the characters are largely forgettable.Production values for this anime appear to be low, especially when it comes to animation. There are scenes where characters look off-model, and items appear and disappear from the screen sometimes. There are lots of still images during action scenes. The art is serviceable, but there’s nothing unique about it. The all-instrumental soundtrack is bland, and doesn’t feel like it was made for this show in particular. The voice acting sounds uninspired.Regarding objectionable content, there’s a fair amount of violence, with a small amount of blood, but no one dies. The antagonists threaten, beat up, kidnap and even slightly torture others. As for nudity, there’s a scene featuring the forced stripping of clothes partially down to a character's underwear, but the only actual nudity is a painting of a nude woman at the school festival shown on screen for a few seconds.Also, there’s one scene that’s hilariously sexist. Matsugoro tells Kyoko, after she tries to stab him, that “women should use knives for cooking.” Apparently this line is so romantic that it immediately makes her go from wanting to kill him to falling in love with him, and there’s even a flashback scene where she’s recalling him saying this to her.All the above being said, I do not dislike this show. I feel that the plot, meandering though it is, is put together well. The cheesiness of some of the lines and character motivations is pretty funny (ex: “My rollerblading gang and I are going to kill you because you injured my little brother’s arm in an arm wrestling match so badly that he couldn’t participate in his scheduled judo competition, and now he’s become a delinquent!”). So while there are a lot of subpar aspects to this OVA, it is an enjoyable watch.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see a cheesy, romantic and relatively lighthearted story starring high school delinquents — just don’t go in expecting stellar production values or any depth to the characters. (Also, it’s important to note that as of this writing, there’s no English version available.)";Mixed Feelings

0;Ashita no Eleven-tachi;ProxyLain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProxyLain;1;"This review contains a lot of spoilers.English is not my language. It may contain errors due to translation.I found this anime here on MyAnimeList out of the blue, I don't even remember how. I like to watch unknown anime, so I looked to see if it was subtitled in any language... Amazingly enough, I got it subtitled in English on YouTube.Well, the anime starts by showing that the main character runs fast like a horse (yes, as exaggerated as it may be, that's exactly what it is).His father and mother died, and he was left with only his younger sister. Both of them stayed in the house of various relatives, until they got to the point of living on a farm, which does not belong to any of their relatives. Because of this, the protagonist started to feel hatred for people.Well, because he runs very fast, two men who are involved in soccer go after him. I honestly don't know where or when these men found out about him. They insist that the protagonist join the soccer team, but he doesn't want to. They insist so much that he challenges them.For some reason they take the protagonist's horse away, just like that, out of the blue, to become a racehorse. Then they promise to let him see the horse if he joins the soccer team. It's kind of lame, because he doesn't even try to stop them from taking his horse away, and he doesn't even want to play soccer.The story fails to explore these little things, which leaves everything very ""meh"" and kind of played out of nowhere.As I said before, it's stupid that the protagonist's nose just lets them take his horse away to bet races and he doesn't stop it. He doesn't even demand to make any money from it. Seriously, it's very silly. All so that later he can be blackmailed into playing for a soccer team.You can see how clueless this is, right? It would be better if it was a horse racing anime than a soccer anime.The protagonist is starting in a national youth team, but out of the blue they say that the world-renowned São Paulo team is going to Japan, and that next year the players in the youth team already have to be drafted to play against strong, world-renowned teams. Yeah, okay... WTF? How come?Another stupid thing: They quote Pelé, a world-known player, and one of the most important soccer players in Brazil (the country I unfortunately live in). So far so good, normal to quote someone famous. BUT THEY DIDN'T PORTRAY HIM AS A BLACK MAN, AND PELÉ IS A BLACK PERSON, NOT JUST A BRUNETTE. Seriously, it's not because it's an anime from the 70's that they didn't know what a world famous player looks like.One of the worst things comes after what I mentioned aboveTHE YOUTH TEAM PLAYS AGAINST SÃO PAULO, WHICH IS A WORLD FAMOUS TEAM. They are showing on TV, youth players against a professional team... what a stupid anime.They are literally professionals against amateurs, who are trying to evolve in soccer to one day become professionals.You know what is funny? The protagonist plays against São Paulo, and he has been playing soccer for not even a year. The protagonist has been training soccer for less than a year, and he is already battling with professionals?The São Paulo player even praises the protagonist (who learned to play at the professional level overnight). And there is another problem in this? he personally goes to talk to the protagonist, BUT HOW CAN A BRAZILIAN PLAYER KNOW HOW TO SPEAK JAPANESE FLUENTLY? Yes, there are Brazilians who speak Japanese, but a soccer player? The right thing is to speak in English, because it is the world language.They even travel around the world in world championships... Yes, a teenager who plays soccer for less than a year already competes in world championships.And yes, the protagonist becomes a soccer star. HahahahahahahahaAh... what a stupid anime!I had mentioned that the protagonist runs fast like a horse, but this is totally ignored during the anime.As you can see, this anime is stupid, illogical and full of nonsense.I cannot accept that a teenager who plays soccer for a few months is already playing in a world championship, traveling around the world.I don't even like soccer and I was already offended by how badly this anime is written, imagine a person who is fanatical about this sport?Anyway, that's it.

0;Shichigahama de Mitsuketa;Domsa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Domsa;6;This was, at the time of the review, available on a Youtube account going by the same name as the series. As the synopsis states, it is a short ONA released by a town with a population of almost 19.000 which commemorates the 10-year anniversary of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Now, I have no idea what those people went through back then as I live in a rather safe from those calamities area, but I'd say it did a pretty good job at portraying both the context and the message even to the likes of me.Production 1.5/3 (5)I won't lie. The production wasn't stellar. It was mediocre at best, considering the background of how this came into existence. It has this rough art style, which I like for some reason. It looks like those sketches you usually do 2-3 years in, but at least they are easy to animate (and I suppose this did not have the budget of the latest Fate movies vOv). So yeah.. I'll cut it some slack. It would be more appropriate to compare it to an animation school project instead. In other words, if you don't mind the rather indie look, go for it.Story 1.4/2 (7)The story was pretty straight-forward. It was not innovative, but, unlike Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 (which I found truly horrendous), this didn't try to capitalize on the shock factor. Instead it chose the 'I have no idea what's happening -> it doesn't look that bad -> ok, maybe our city's destroyed' route.It didn't even spend that much time on how atrocious the earthquake and tsunami have been. The message wasn't 'earthquake bad, the world is ending' and that was great. We've got through it, we've rebuilt our small haven and we moved on. Now that's a much more respectable take on the ordeal. Imho, this mentality is what managed to bounce Japan back from what happened and I found this series to be a pretty good portrayal of it, even thought it didn't go in-depth on the aforementioned aspects.Characters 0.5/1 (5)How much can you see in such a short time? To be honest, the characters were average Joes and that's perfect. The glasses girl was pretty much a self-insert for the audience. Look how far we've managed to get in those 10 years.Sound 0.6/1 (6)Nothing peculiar in this regard either, but the voice acting was rather good. Unexpectedly good considering the overall production and the fact that it has been done by a small town.Enjoyment 1.8/3 (6)I am not the target audience, but, despite that and the fact that I cannot fully comprehend the fear of calamities, I found the message and the path this took in order to convey it to be rather beautiful. 'It doesn't matter what happens in your daily life, what's important is getting over it' - Costel, compactor roller operator.Total = 5.8 (fine)Rating a commemorative series such as this on a normal scale is unfair, but I consider it good for its kind. It made me think about what happened and that was its purpose. Unlike Nihon Chinbotsu, this is not so stupid you can't take it seriously and it also has a meaningful message.;Mixed Feelings
0;Rhythm;Shimbels;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shimbels;3;"(3 is a good score more, see my profile)I am very comfortable rating this higher than both Fullmetal Alchemist and Samurai Champloo.The clue is in the name people: Rhythm. Yesterday, the 3rd of January, was my Birthday, after unfortunately getting up at 5am to go to work I decided to spend the rest of it with my family exercising my identity as an avant-weeaboo. While in a really very good Japanese restaurant I told to my Mum why I think Haiku is a symbol of the insidious influence of Western capitalist jingoism on Japanese (nationalist) culture and why I don't often care for overly literary films. I think I remember vaguely alluding to the first point pretty well in my recent Ponyo review so here I will vaguely allude to the second one.""At Darmstadt I was talking about the reason back of pulverization and fragmentation: for instance, using syllables instead of words in a vocal text, letters instead of syllables. I said, “We take things apart in order that they may become the Buddha. And if that seems too Oriental an idea for you,” I said, “Remember the early Christian Gnostic statement, 'Split the stick and there is Jesus!’ ”""- John Cage, Indeterminacy 1959John Cage by this means that we take an art down to its syllables: sounds that have no meaning - and then from there we may choose to build them back into words, which do have meaning, or we may choose to do something quite different with them. We may indeed choose to build a kind of mechanism, something which does not mean anything but whirrs and wiggles in its way and ends up resembling nothing but what it is, which may be very beautiful. I'm not entirely sure what the syllables of a film are: it may be frames, but they are essentially just paintings or photographs. It may be Time, according to my other aesthetic hero Andrei Tarkovsky. If it is that wholly abstract thing, time, then our brains might need to get a grip on it via its handholds, the rhythm of a shot. In any moving picture there will be some degree of churning, the bits and pieces probably have some kind of direction, a cardinal direction that is. They move from some region of the screen to another, or from an imaginary point off screen to an different imaginary point off screen, and happen to pass through the part we can see.This film consists of nothing but bits and pieces moving in a direction, and though it is only two minutes long and truth be told not exactly good enough to totally warrant this spiel I have written, I think it is a good example of ""something quite different"" built from the syllables of film.Review Epilogue:This film has a really neat soundtrack. It's an electronic offering by a man/entity known only to me as POL. If you have any information about this man/entity then please message me about them.";Not Recommended
1;Rhythm;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;2;Rate a 2Completely silent film with no subtitlesart pieceStoryI detest animes that are solely visual unpleasant. Aside from a missing disclosure on those who are sensitive to light the entire show was a 'revolving disaster'. The main concern i had here was the intro. Mind you i am a detail oriented individual in some manners. Why the '1934' if marked as a 1935? My theory is the creation was in 1934 but due to some oversight in production time or simple case of memory loss it was not changed. Aside from that the plot was a mess due its complete lack of plot. Sad to say but i think i would know more about rhythm by going to a dance party or watching my clothes run through the washer.Art-black and white. Not the right type of setup i would use to express the topic of rhythm. For Rhythm to me is the expression of moment and the patterns presented that are affected by gravity.-Artistic drawing level. Not sure what precise message was being shown but i couldn't help but to notice the gradual lack of detail as the film progressed.Enjoyment:I believe the target audience for this piece would either be instrument players or music majors.;Not Recommended

The music definitely fits the mood for this clip, from a calm reggae to death metal, you get a rollercoaster of emotions just by watching and listening the video.This story also describes most human beings's struggle they face every morning when trying to wake up, and how to cope with it and face the cold and cruel world.;Recommended
0;Kamishibai Itazura Tanuki no Maki;cyborgmug;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cyborgmug;9;I’ve recently been watching a whole bunch of prewar animations, and while a large amount of them are interesting only as historical artifacts, there are a few legitimate gems in there too. Thus far of the films I’ve watched, Rascal Raccoon is the highlight. It is genuinely funny with some good gags thrown in there, and in particular the animation is fantastic.The setpiece of the short is a fight scene that is smoothly animated, fast-paced and actually surprisingly reminiscent of something you would find in modern anime: Clever characters thinking on their feet and using their fighting skills and all kinds of tricks to get one over on their opponent. And, unlike usually in these very early animations, the animation successfully employs varying angles that make the action feel dynamic and engaging.I believe reviewing any art has to done while keeping its historical context in mind. Of course this film is fairly basic in every way compared to anime released today or even thirty or forty years ago, but it’s also unfair and frankly absurd to compare it to them. In the context of everything else made during that era of Japanese animation, it’s an excellently fun little ride and well worth watching, unlike a lot of its contemporaries.;Recommended

A movie marked for all ages presented itself in a stage setting for kids. Sadly, the show like the main character kept changing but not for the better. As the story progress we learn the main character's motivation behind his action. We also learn his skill of the trade so to type. However, becomes tragically unwoven as misconception when the 'mark of the ninja' is bestowed upon him? How?! Where did one (audience) see that? Truth is we didn't. If you present a skill you must stay true to it. If it requires water stay with water not fire. If requires hearing stay with hearing not sight. As for the conclusion where the story really counts for this is where the message is delivered the story failed. Mind you, this was marked as 'all ages'. Not only did this lack in message but the sense of any message that could exist one would see as negative rather than positive. An example of a good message is don't cure. An example of a bad message cheat your friends and family.Artblack and whitetransition are okaySound- can't comment, does not apply.Character- a little bit of pre-context of what happened with the main character to begin with that brought him into this position in life would have been a nice touch.;Not Recommended
0;Eun-sil-i;chevybow;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chevybow;4;"Eun-sil-i is an uncomfortable korean animation film. It is intentionally uncomfortable as it covers very serious topics- but I found its execution and overall premise to be seriously lacking. There will be minor spoilers in this review.The movie opens up with a young girl being pronounced dead after giving birth to her child- a baby covered in blood is brought by a boy who discovers the dead body. As the movie goes on- it deals with both the present day town and how they are treating the baby of the dead mother, as well as going into the past and revealing memories of Eun-sil, the girl who died while giving birth.While not immediately apparent at the start of the film, unless you read the plot summary beforehand, Eun-sil is mentally retarded. She befriends the main character in the movie, though they eventually get into an argument. My main issue with the scene that deals with this argument is that it seems out of character. The main character seems to overall be very kind of Eun-sil and shows great generosity, yet out of nowhere she finally decides she has enough with the slowness of Eun-sil and they argue.Eun-sil is taken advantage by several men of the village and a number of them rape her- a few short scenes occur while the rape is happening, but it would not be surprising if just about every guy in town had their way with Eun-sil since they knew they could. While this rape is a major focus in the show, it seems like it was done unrealistically. In fact- all the characters and how evil they are is pretty unrealistic.Not only do a number of men, including someone from Eun-sil's school- a fellow classmate, rape her: but there are witnesses to many of the rapes by fellow classmates. No one does anything and it doesn't seem that anyone really cares save for maybe 2 women in the entire town. Every character, except for Eun-sil and another girl that gets taken advantage of, is uncharacteristically evil. I just cannot wrap my head around the idea that an entire town in Korea would be okay with raping a mentally disabled young girl, but that after she gives birth to her child they care little about the child's well-being and wish for it to be dead (with many attempts to kill the baby having taken place in the movie). It is just not believable.Perhaps the attempted killing of the baby is done by certain women in the film because they know about the rape and believe that by killing the baby they will have put this whole Eun-sil thing to rest for good. But I just don't buy that people would actually act this way. And while not all anime have to be realistic- there is nothing to suggest that this town is some sort of cult or that there are supernatural elements to this world. It is unusual for me to see people behave this way and it definitely took me out of the film, and the shocking scenes just kept coming- which made it lose its impact on me every time.At the end of this movie I'm just left wondering ""why"". There is no real resolution to this film, nothing you'd really call an impactful ""ending"". Nothing is really solved at the end- everyone in the town is still shitty, the main character of the film and her friend end up moving back to Seoul- leaving the town for good. I'm just not sure if this movie really had a message. It is a story of an abused mentally ill girl- and goes into great detail of the abuse- but that is all it is. No one is really held accountable for the abuse, no good comes out of the abuse (or nothing bad either). The story just does not really go anywhere meaningful.I give this a 4/10. I would call this a bad movie, but I appreciate it attempting to tackle difficult issues. It is definitely a unique watch.";Not Recommended
0;Virtual Star 2000;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;3;"In short, it's a studio show-reel, where an animation studio goes ""Durrr hurrrr look at all the neat 3-D CGI animation we can do!!!"" Six short animation bits, around five minutes each, nobody really says anything but there is musical accompaniment in the background. Each one showcasing a different lithesome computer generated girl going through some sort of motion-capture routine, in different settings.May have been state of the art level of graphics around 1999, but compared to what is available today (when I write this 2019), it does not age very well. Rather than marvel at all the neat things they can do, and how ""realistic"" the girls look, you spend more time spotting obvious animation errors, overall jankiness, or how ""dead-eyes"" or fake looking the characters seem.

0;Kiku-chan to Ookami;MaouNemesis;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MaouNemesis;7;"When Japan lost in the World War II, it was a shock to all Japanese citizens, not only in their native country, but also worldwide and the same was for people living in the Japantowns that were made in Manchuria.Citizens worrying for their lives as the Soviets and Chinese get closer, flee their homes to Korea. But the journey is long and harsh and soon a lot of them have to sacrifice those who have been shot in the air raids, have fallen from exhaustion or are sick.One of those who were left behind is a little girl named Kiku who on her way got measles. Her fate would be pretty much death if it wasn't... for a wolf.This story is about two seemingly completely opposite heroines. First is Kiku, a little human girl that catches measles during the escape and was left behind by her mother, who at first didn't wanted to do such a thing, and the other character is an old female wolf who tires to catch any pray to survive.When the old wolf waits to ambush the humans, she falls asleep and wakes up when everyone is gone. Looking through the place she finds the sick Kiku who at first mistakes the wolf for her dog. When the wolf checks the girl and finds out that she's feverish, she immediately finds some herbs and feeds them to Kiku, saving her life. The old wolf, who probably awoke to her motherly instincts, knows that a human child can't survive on its own decides to take Kiku to a human settlement instead of eating her.The story is based on the ""Toshi-Oi Mesu-Ookami to Onna no Ko no Hanashi"" (The Story of the Old Mother Wolf and the Girl) that was written by Akiyuki Nosaka, the author of ""The Grave of the Fireflies"", and despite that Nosaka also created the stories for other Sensou Douwa, this one is one of the most touching and shows off Nosaka's writing style the most.The artwork and the animation are simplified in the movie, but in a lesser degree than in other Sensou Douwa stories.The music is great and fits the scenes very well, the ending song is very touching and completes the overall story.If you watched the other Sensou Douwa stories then this one is also a must!";Recommended
0;Popful Mail;FAKEANIMEGIRL;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FAKEANIMEGIRL;3;"This five minute music video set to Megumi Hayashibara's ""No No Pessimist"" was meant to pitch a Popful Mail OVA to potential producers, but in the end nothing was made. Popful Mail itself was originally a Falcom video game, a role-playing and platforming genre hybrid released for multiple consoles in various versions with the most notable of those being the Sega CD. The game itself is quite fun and a fascinating piece of niche game design, though not without its faults (many exacerbated by Working Designs's localization and gameplay changes). This short anime which is literally all music and no other audio pumps the tiniest bit more life into Popful Mail which always seemed like something Falcom wanted to be bigger than its commercial success justified. For that alone, this short has enough in it to rejuvenate the same feelings the games did with its strong sense of humor and childish, manic characters. If the plot featured here is any indication of what the OVA would've been, then it would have had an original storyline where Mail is transported to the real world and teams up with a young human girl against a new villain with magical powers who sends his troops through the same portal. In that case, maybe it's a good thing the OVA didn't happen because video game/reality crossover stories have always been weak from my memory (Ganbare Goemon, Captain N, arguably Sonic X). Other than that, the song is all right, the animation is fluid but nothing spectacular otherwise, and the scene where Mail is surrounded and swooned over by bespectacled otaku in the real world is the most ongoing legacy this forgotten short ended up having.";Not Recommended

# AnimeListScraper

This is a web scraper made using [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) to scrape [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) website.

This project uses [Chrome webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) to automate the scraping process. 

The resulting data is saved in semicolon delimited [CSV](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/what-is-csv-file) files and are still [dirty](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1194/dirty-data).

I wouldn't recommend running the scraper since it takes quite a while to retrieve the data.
